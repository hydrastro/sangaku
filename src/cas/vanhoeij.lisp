; lib/cas/vanhoeij.lisp -- VAN HOEIJ CORRECTION TERMS for the integral basis of a GENERAL plane curve F(x,y)=0.
; This closes the last Rung-4 gap (docs/TRAGER_ROADMAP.md): for a superelliptic curve y^n = g the integral
; basis has the pure-power form {y^j / d_j} (handled by intbasis.lisp), but for a general curve a basis element
; is w_j = (y^j + sum_{i<j} c_{j,i}(x) y^i) / d_j(x) -- a LOWER-degree-in-y numerator.  The c_{j,i} are the
; "correction terms" that cancel the poles the naive y^j/d_j would have.
;
; The construction at a rational place x = a (Puiseux ramification q = 1, the common case): a single branch is a
; genuine power series y(x) = sum coeffs[i] (x-a)^{p+i}.  The element (y - c(x))/(x-a)^k is integral there iff
; y - c vanishes to order >= k, so the correction is c(x) = the part of the branch BELOW order k -- "subtract
; the singular part".  Subtracting it raises the valuation from < k up to >= k, exactly cancelling the pole.
; The same idea lifts a level-j element: subtract the lower-order behaviour read from the branch.
;
; Integrality is certified with the general-F Puiseux valuation oracle of intbasis.lisp (ib-integral-at0?,
; which already accepts an arbitrary numerator N(x,y) and the branches from pg-branches).  For a ramified place
; (q > 1) or several branches needing a combined correction, the simple single-branch construction does not
; suffice and this module reports 'needs-place-combination rather than guessing -- preserving soundness.
;
; Public:
;   vh-branches F M             -> the Puiseux branches of F at x = 0 (via pg-branches)
;   vh-integral-at0? N k F M    -> #t iff N(x,y)/x^k is integral at x=0 (reuses the general-F oracle)
;   vh-correction br k          -> c(x): the part of a rational branch below order k (the singular part), or
;                                  'needs-place-combination if the branch is ramified (q>1)
;   vh-correct-level1 F k M     -> (list 'corrected c d-power) giving w = (y - c)/x^k integral, with a witness
;                                  that y/x^k was NOT integral; or 'no-correction-needed / 'needs-...
;   vh-certify-correction F N k M -> #t iff N/x^k is integral AND (N without its constant-in-y part)/x^k is not
;                                  (i.e. the correction genuinely matters)
;
; Verified: on y = x + x^2 + x^3, (y - x)/x^2 and (y - x - x^2)/x^3 are integral while y/x^2, y/x^3 are not; on
; y^2 - 2xy - x^3, the integrality oracle correctly classifies y/x (integral) vs y/x^2 (pole).
;
; Builds on intbasis.lisp (the valuation oracle) and puiseuxg.lisp (general-F Puiseux), over poly.lisp.
