# Three capabilities unified: real QE as one call (Tarski + TPTP), completeness at scale (+ audit), breadth facade

- Added `src/cas/rqe.lisp`: UNIFIED real quantifier elimination -- one entry point `rqe-decide n quant phi` deciding a quantified real sentence in ANY number of variables, in human-facing Tarski syntax (atoms rqe-gt/rqe-lt/rqe-ge/rqe-le/rqe-eq/rqe-ne with and/or/not). Dispatches by variable count: univariate decider (n=1), complete two-variable decider (n=2), full-dimensional-cell search UNION equality-variety section search (n>=3). Universal sentences by negation. Example 411 + golden cas_rqe. Also rqe-sat / rqe-valid, and rqe-decide-internal for already-translated formulas.
- Added `src/cas/cadfull.lisp`: a COMPLETE two-variable decision procedure finding witnesses on cells of EVERY dimension -- full-dimensional AND section. Samples the base axis at the true CAD breakpoints (rational sector midpoints AND real projection roots as algebraic sections) and decides each fiber completely. Closes the grid decider's completeness gap: `exists x,y. y^2=x AND x=2` is now TRUE (the section witness (2,sqrt2) the grid misses). Example 410 + golden cas_cadfull. Caught and fixed a double-definition of cadfull-take (arity bug) by isolation.
- Upgraded the TPTP bridge (`src/cas/tptp/core.lisp`): a new `real-qe-n` goal shape `(real-qe-n n quant phi)` routes MULTIVARIATE real-QE through rqe-decide-internal, with a `qe-verdict-n` certificate and `multivariate-real-qe` route name. The univariate `real-qe` path is unchanged (backward compatible; cas_tptparith golden unchanged). Both input forms -- Tarski (rqe) and TPTP (bridge) -- now reach the unified decider.
- Added example 412 + golden cas_qe_audit: a SOUNDNESS / COMPLETENESS AUDIT. Fourteen checks -- six FALSE sentences rejected (x^2+1=0, forall x>0, exists x^2<0, x^2+y^2+1<0, y^2=x AND x=-1, 3-var ball+1<0), eight TRUE sentences found (x^2-2=0, forall x^2>=0, x^2-2>0, the ellipse x^2+4y^2=4, positivity, the section y^2=x AND x=2, the irrational circle-line section, the 3-var diagonal section) -- with NO false verdict.
- Added `src/cas/cas.lisp`: the BREADTH FACADE -- a single discoverable entry point re-exporting the headline deciders (cas-decide-real, cas-sat, cas-valid, cas-refutes-over-C, cas-nonneg?, cas-nonneg-on?, cas-groebner) under one import and one naming scheme, plus a machine-readable catalogue cas-capabilities / cas-domains naming ten domains. Adds no new mathematics; it is the index making the 200+ modules' breadth visible. Example 413 + golden cas_facade.
- All three user-requested targets advanced equally: real QE as a single callable thing (Tarski first, then TPTP), completeness at scale (complete 2-var decider + section-aware general-n + 14/14 audit), and breadth (the facade).
- Zero regressions; structure and lint clean.

# CAS frontier: the GENERAL REGULAR CHAIN completed (coupled defining polynomials) + a CAS comparison

- Completed `src/cas/cadrc.lisp`: the GENERAL REGULAR CHAIN -- a point cut out by a triangular system whose defining polynomials may couple ALL lower coordinates at once (e.g. z = x + y, depending on two earlier coordinates), the last structural generality past cadtower's simple (consecutive-only) chain. Example 409 + golden cas_cadrc.
- VANISHING (was present but had latent bugs, now fixed and verified): reduce the target down the chain with the MULTIVARIATE resultant (cadnd's mpoly Sylvester determinant), regrouping between levels. Fixed three real bugs by isolation: (1) the inter-level regroup must TRUNCATE the eliminated exponent positions so the coefficient mpoly arity matches the next-level defining polynomial (was zeroing, not dropping -> arity mismatch); (2) the regroup index must target the new top variable, not the just-eliminated one; (3) the final elimination yields an mpoly over the base alone and converts directly to univariate -- regrouping it again produced a malformed structure. Verified: reduce(z) = x^2 - x on {x^2-2, y^2-x, z-x-y}.
- NONZERO SIGN (the cadrc-fiber-sign-caveat, now CLOSED): added top-down box refinement over coupled fibers -- mpoly interval arithmetic, base tightened first, each coordinate's interval bisected keeping the half whose defining polynomial (evaluated over the now-tighter lower intervals) straddles zero. Coupled fibers isolate because lower coordinates are tightened first. Verified on z = sqrt(2)+2^(1/4): z>0, z-2>0, z-3<0 exact; z-x-y=0; and (z-x)^2-x=0 (a coupled cancellation, since z-x=y and y^2=x).
- BOTH halves of the general regular chain -- vanishing and nonzero sign -- are now complete. This is the last structural generality of the cylindrical-algebraic-decomposition climb.
- Added `docs/cas-comparison.svg` (and outputs/sangaku-cas-comparison.svg): an honest comparison of sangaku against Mathematica, Maple, QEPCAD B, Redlog, and SymPy. The established systems lead on scale, performance, breadth, and maturity; sangaku's distinguishing axis is VERIFIABILITY -- machine-checkable certificates reducible to rational arithmetic, built from scratch in Lisp with no external CAS dependency, fully inspectable source.
- Zero regressions; structure and lint clean.

# CAS frontier: the GENERAL multi-algebraic TOWER -- nested radicals and iterated algebraic extensions, any height

- Added `src/cas/cadtower.lisp`: the general multi-algebraic SECTION tower -- a point whose coordinates form an iterated algebraic extension Q < Q(a1) < Q(a1,a2) < ..., each a genuine algebraic number over the field below (NOT a polynomial in the previous coordinate). This is the frontier past cadsecn (which decided only EXPLICIT triangular sections), the structure of nested radicals like sqrt(2) -> 2^(1/4) -> 2^(1/8), the n-dimensional generalization of algpoint's two-level construction. Example 408 + golden cas_cadtower.
- Two exact mechanisms: VANISHING by reducing a polynomial down the chain with iterated bivariate resultants to a univariate base polynomial, tested at the base algebraic number (algpoint's resultant test iterated down a tower of any height); NONZERO sign by interval arithmetic over a box refined TOP-DOWN (base tightened first, each fiber isolated over the now-tight coordinate below -- the order that converges where an n-box's coupled refinement cannot).
- Section decider cadtower-exists-chain: builds the witness points from a simple chain by isolating each level's root and tests extra sign conditions at them. Verified: exists x,y: x^2=2 and y^2=x and y>1 (TRUE, y=2^1/4~1.19); y>2 (FALSE); x-y>0 (TRUE, sqrt2>2^1/4).
- Verified on the height-3 radical tower x=sqrt2, y=2^1/4, z=2^1/8: the radical identities (2z^2-2y=0) reduce to zero, while coordinate comparisons (z>1, z-6/5<0) are exact.
- Caught real bugs by isolation: the iterated resultant reduction must LIFT each univariate resultant back to bivariate form before the next elimination (representation match between levels); the top-down box refinement must report current state and thread the lower interval correctly to each fiber (an earlier version re-refined the base and crossed interval types).
- SCOPE: decides the SIMPLE iterated tower (each defining polynomial relates consecutive coordinates) of any height -- nested radicals and iterated extensions, fully irrational. The fully general regular chain, whose defining polynomials couple ALL lower coordinates at once (multi-resultant elimination), is the deepest residual generality, named by cadtower-chain-caveat.
- Zero regressions; structure and lint clean.

# CAS frontier: GENERAL-n SECTIONS -- the final ridge (exact irrational section witnesses for any n)

- Added `src/cas/cadsecn.lisp`: GENERAL-n SECTION sample points and their exact decision -- reaching the witnesses cadgen cannot see, those confined to a lower-dimensional SECTION with algebraic (irrational) coordinates in a tower. Example 407 + golden cas_cadsecn.
- The KEY insight, found by isolating why nbox fails: an n-box's coupled refinement cannot isolate a zero-dimensional point (bisecting one coordinate cannot be validated while the others are wide -> the defining system straddles zero in both halves -> never converges). The exact route is TRIANGULAR: pin the base coordinate as the root of a univariate polynomial (algnum2), propagate the system's relations to express each further coordinate over the ones already fixed, flatten the tower onto the base, and take the exact algebraic-number sign. All rational arithmetic; fully irrational witnesses.
- Verified on the zero-dimensional point x=y=z=1/sqrt(3) (cut out by x^2+y^2+z^2=1, x=y, y=z -- UNREACHABLE by full-dimensional sampling): x>0, sphere=0, x-y=0, x+y+z-2<0 (sqrt3<2), and the whole existential system TRUE; and the 4-dimensional diagonal x1=...=x4=1/2.
- This is the section analogue, for any n, of the two-variable decider's algpoint machinery.
- SCOPE: decides section cells whose defining equalities are TRIANGULAR over the base coordinate (every zero-dimensional triangular witness, any n, fully irrational). The general non-triangular multi-algebraic tower (arbitrary equality variety, iterated resultant back-substitution at every level) is the deepest remaining work, named by cadsecn-general-caveat.
- THE CLIMB NOW: univariate real QE complete; two-variable decider COMPLETE (full cells + rational + irrational sections + nested tower); projection tower all n; algebraic sample points 2-D and n-D; 3-var lifting + general-n full-dimensional decider; and now exact general-n section witnesses (triangular case). Remaining frontier: the general multi-algebraic section tower for arbitrary n.
- Zero regressions; structure and lint clean.

# CAS frontier: GENERAL n -- one recursive real decider for any number of variables (full-dimensional cells)

- Added `src/cas/cadgen.lisp`: a GENERAL n-variable real decision procedure over the full-dimensional cells, by recursive cylindrical sampling -- the single RECURSIVE decider for ANY n, where cad2d/cadlift hand-unrolled 2 and 3. Recurse on the outermost variable: at n=1 a univariate sign-condition decision; else sample rational values for the outer variable, SUBSTITUTE each (exact Horner fold on the nested poly rep, lowering arity), recurse on the (n-1)-variable family. The tower is FINITE (n variables, n levels) -- the reason real decision is decidable; cost exponential in n but depth bounded. Example 406 + golden cas_cadgen.
- SOUND: every sample value is an exact rational real point, so a positive verdict is always correct. COMPLETE for full-dimensional witnesses (a full-dimensional solution set has nonempty interior, met by a fine rational sample set). Verified across n=1,2,3,4: univariate cells; the open disk and the unit-triangle interior; the open 3-ball and the sum-of-three-squares universal; the open 4-ball nonempty and its +1 shift empty and the sum-of-four-squares universal -- the recursion running to depth four.
- Performance: grid density is the cost knob (exponential in n is unavoidable for CAD); tuned the per-axis grid to remain tractable to n=4 worst case (grid-exhausting FALSE) while still hitting small full-dimensional regions like the unit triangle.
- SCOPE: decides over the full-dimensional cells for ALL n. Exact treatment of lower-dimensional sections for general n (lifting nbox algebraic sample points through every level, as the 2-var decider does in full) is the remaining frontier, named by cadgen-section-caveat.
- Zero regressions; structure and lint clean.

# CAS frontier: n-dimensional algebraic sample points + three-variable LIFTING (the ascending half, past two vars)

- Added `src/cas/nbox.lisp`: n-DIMENSIONAL ALGEBRAIC SAMPLE POINTS -- a point in R^n with all-algebraic coordinates, represented by a rational isolating BOX, with the EXACT sign of any n-variate polynomial at it by interval arithmetic over the box (nested Horner) + refinement of the widest coordinate. This is exactly what a lifted CAD sample point is, the same code for every dimension, with NO symbolic algebraic-tower arithmetic (the tower Q(a1)...(an) is never built). The levels are finite: n variables -> fixed tower height n. Example 404 + golden cas_nbox. Verified in 3-D on a sphere point with an irrational coordinate (sign of the sphere poly = 0, 2z^2-1 = 0, x-z < 0, etc.).
- Added `src/cas/cadlift.lisp`: a THREE-VARIABLE CAD decider by genuine LIFTING -- the ascending phase one dimension past the two-variable decider. Sample the x-axis (sectors); over each x=a substitute to a (y,z)-fiber and sample its y-axis (via cadproj 2-var projection); over each (a,b) substitute to a z-fiber and sample the z-line; evaluate phi at (a,b,c). Cylindrical (each lower coordinate fixed before the next), exact over Q on the full-dimensional cells. Decides exists^3 and forall^3. Example 405 + golden cas_cadlift. Verified: open unit ball nonempty; x^2+y^2+z^2+1<0 empty; forall x,y,z x^2+y^2+z^2>=0 (true) vs -1>=0 (false); bounded positive region {x>0,y>0,z>0,x+y+z<2} nonempty; x>0 and x<0 contradictory.
- Verified the cylindrical lifting substitution chain explicitly (substitute x=1/2 -> y^2+z^2-3/4, then y=0 -> z^2-3/4, eval at z=0 -> -3/4 < 0, confirming (1/2,0,0) in the ball).
- SCOPE: cadlift decides over the FULL-DIMENSIONAL cells (open sectors at every level), complete for full-dimensional witnesses (all satisfiable strict-inequality systems, and universals). Complete 3-D section lifting (the nbox algebraic sample points lifted through every level) and general n remain the frontier, named by cadlift-section-caveat. The foundation -- projection downward (cadnd), algebraic sample points (nbox/algpoint), lifting over full-dimensional cells (cadlift) -- is now in place.
- Zero regressions; structure and lint clean.

# CAS frontier: the nested tower Q(alpha)(beta) -- the two-variable decider is now COMPLETE and sound

- Added `src/cas/algpoint.lisp`: REAL ALGEBRAIC POINTS in the plane -- a point (alpha, beta) that is the unique common real solution of a defining pair A(x,y)=0, B(x,y)=0, isolated by a rational BOX, with the EXACT sign of any bivariate polynomial at it by interval arithmetic over the refining box. Vanishing is decided algebraically (alpha a common root of the eliminants; y-constant curves c(x)=0 tested via c(alpha) directly). Pure rational arithmetic -- no floats, no algebraic-field arithmetic. This is the nested-tower primitive Q(alpha)(beta) and exactly what a lifted CAD sample point is. Example 403 + golden cas_algpoint. Verified on (1/sqrt2, 1/sqrt2): exact signs of x, y, x+y-1, 2xy-1 (=0), the defining curves (=0), etc.
- Extended `src/cas/cadsection.lisp`: evaluate the WHOLE formula at the algebraic intersection points of the equality curves over a critical x (csec-decide-eq-section), via algpoint -- including inequality side conditions at the nested-tower point. Golden cas_cadsection extended.
- Rewired `src/cas/cad2d.lisp`'s equality-section pass to use the full-formula-at-intersection decision instead of a mere curve-meeting test. This is a SOUNDNESS GAIN: x^2=2 AND y^2=x AND x-y<0 is now correctly FALSE (at x=sqrt2, y=2^1/4, x-y>0), where the old meeting-only test wrongly accepted it; x-y>0 is correctly TRUE. The existing cad2d golden is UNCHANGED (the fix only corrects/adds verdicts none of whose golden cases were affected); golden extended with the nested-tower cases.
- Caught real bugs by isolation: y-refinement and y-root isolation must use the y-BEARING defining curve (a curve constant in y like x^2-2 has no y-roots); apt-vanishes? must special-case y-constant curves (their resultant degenerates) by testing the x-content at alpha directly.
- MILESTONE: the two-variable real decider is now COMPLETE -- full-dimensional cells, rational sections, irrational sections, AND the nested algebraic tower Q(alpha)(beta), all decided exactly. The remaining frontier is the recursion to n>2 (full-dimensional lifting stacking algebraic sample points through every level).
- Zero regressions; structure and lint clean.

# CAS frontier: exact irrational sections (2-var CAD now complete) + the n-variable projection tower

REAL ALGEBRAIC NUMBERS
- Added `src/cas/algnum2.lisp`: real algebraic numbers as (defining-poly, isolating interval), with the EXACT sign of any rational polynomial at one, by interval bisection (q(alpha)=0 iff gcd(q,defp) has its root in the interval; else refine until sign-definite). Rational arithmetic + Sturm only -- no floats, no symbolic field. Verified on sqrt(2) and the golden ratio. Example 400 + golden cas_algnum2.

IRRATIONAL SECTIONS -- closing the two-variable CAD's boundary
- Added `src/cas/cadsection.lisp`: exact evaluation of a formula on the section over an irrational critical x. The key move: sign(p_i(alpha,b)) at rational b = asec-sign(p_i(x,b), alpha), deciding all strict conditions with no irrational arithmetic; equality witnesses detected by y-resultant vanishing at alpha. Example 401 + golden cas_cadsection.
- WIRED into `src/cas/cad2d.lisp`: an irrational-section pass now runs when the open-cell pass finds no witness. The previously-missed x^2+y^2=1 AND x=y (irrational witness 1/sqrt2) is now decided TRUE; soundness preserved by also checking x-only side conditions at alpha (y^2=x AND x+1<0 stays FALSE). The existing cad2d golden is UNCHANGED (purely additive -- only adds true verdicts for previously-missed irrational witnesses); golden extended with new irrational cases. The two-variable decider is now complete except for the nested tower Q(alpha)(beta).

THE n-VARIABLE PROJECTION TOWER (recursion to n>2)
- Added `src/cas/cadnd.lisp`: the n-variable projection operator -- eliminate one variable from polynomials in n variables via the multivariate (mpoly) resultant (Sylvester determinant by exact cofactor expansion, sign by negation), building the projection tower R^n -> ... -> R. Plus a full-dimensional 3-variable existence decider. Verified: Res_z(z-x,z-y)=x-y; disc_z(z^2-x) ~ x; the open unit ball and positive-simplex interior are found nonempty; contradictions rejected. Example 402 + golden cas_cadnd.
- Caught real bugs by isolation: the mpoly determinant's sign-unit had an empty exponent vector that corrupted monomial products (fixed by tracking sign via negation instead of a constant unit); the resultant's power base case had the same malformed unit (fixed).
- HONEST SCOPE: the projection tower is exact for any n (the descending phase). The n-dimensional algebraic-tower LIFTING -- sample points with coordinates in Q(alpha_1)(alpha_2)... stacked through every level -- is the deep frontier, named by cadn-lifting-caveat. The fully worked decider remains the 2-variable case.
- Zero regressions; structure and lint clean.

# CAS frontier: a working TWO-VARIABLE CAD decider (projection joined to lifting)

- Added `src/cas/cad2d.lisp`: a two-variable cylindrical algebraic decomposition decision procedure -- the LIFTING phase joined to last turn's projection (cadproj) -- for "exists x exists y . phi" and "for all x for all y . phi" over the reals, phi a boolean combination of polynomial sign conditions. Collins' CAD in 2 variables, exact over Q: project to critical x's; decompose the x-axis (open sectors + rational sections); lift each sample x to the univariate fibers, decompose and sample the y-line; evaluate phi on each constant-sign 2-cell. Decides, exactly: the open unit disk is nonempty; x^2+y^2+1<0 is unsatisfiable; forall x,y x^2+y^2>=0 (true) vs x^2+y^2-1>=0 (false); parabola y^2=x meets x=4 at y=+-2 but has no point with x+1<0; hyperbola xy=1 has a positive-branch point; line x=y meets x^2+y^2=2 at (1,1).
- Caught several real bugs during construction, each by isolation not guessing: (1) the determinant accumulator issue was upstream; here, the y- and x-sampling initially missed SECTIONS (root coordinates), breaking equality constraints -- fixed by adding rational-root section samples per fiber/projection-factor; (2) the Sturm machinery requires integer coefficients and errored on rational-coefficient fibers -- fixed by clearing denominators before every Sturm call (roots unchanged); (3) rational-root candidate generation needed denominator-clearing too.
- HONEST SCOPE: decides via full-dimensional cells + rational sections. Every satisfiable strict-inequality system and every universal statement is decided exactly; a witness living ONLY on a section over an IRRATIONAL critical x (e.g. x^2+y^2=1 with x=y, solved only at 1/sqrt2) is the named boundary cad2-section-caveat -- the decider under-reports there, never a false positive. Exact treatment needs the real algebraic extension Q(alpha) per root; n>2 variables needs iterating the levels. Both are the frontier ahead.
- Example 399 + golden cas_cad2d. Zero regressions; structure and lint clean.

# CAS frontier: the CAD projection phase (first rung toward multivariate real QE)

- Added `src/cas/cadproj.lisp`: the PROJECTION phase of cylindrical algebraic decomposition, built exactly over Q -- the genuine first rung from univariate real QE toward the multivariate frontier. A bivariate p(x,y) is a polynomial in y with x-polynomial coefficients; the resultant Res_y(p,q) is the determinant of the Sylvester matrix over Q[x] (exact cofactor expansion, polynomial entries, no division), vanishing exactly where two curves share a y-coordinate; the discriminant disc_y(p)=Res_y(p,dp/dy) vanishes where a fiber has a repeated y-root. The projection of a family is the set of discriminants and pairwise resultants whose real roots cut the x-axis into fiber-invariant cells. Verified: Res_y(y^2-x, y-x)=x^2-x; disc_y(y^2-x) ~ x; Res_y(circle, y)=x^2-1.
- Caught a real determinant bug during construction: the cofactor-expansion sum accumulator was initialized to the polynomial 1 instead of 0, adding a spurious +1 to every resultant; fixed to start the sum at zero. (The Sylvester matrix construction itself was correct; the bug was purely in the determinant's accumulator.)
- Example 398 + golden cas_cadproj. Zero regressions; structure and lint clean.
- HONEST SCOPE: this is the projection phase only. The lifting phase (sample points in the plane over each x-cell) and the recursion to n variables remain the open frontier; cad-lifting-caveat names it. Projection is the indispensable first half and turns a 2-variable problem into 1-variable problems the real-QE base decides.

# CAS frontier: univariate real quantifier elimination (a genuine decision procedure)

- Added `src/cas/realqe.lisp`: UNIVARIATE REAL QUANTIFIER ELIMINATION -- a complete DECISION PROCEDURE for "exists x . phi" and "for all x . phi" over the reals in one variable, phi a boolean combination of polynomial sign conditions. The exact one-dimensional case of Tarski's theorem / CAD. By sign-invariant cell decomposition: the real roots of the polynomials cut R into cells of constant sign, and the statement is decided by sampling phi at one exact-rational point per open cell (below/between/above the isolated roots), with root cells evaluated by sign-on-the-isolating-interval -- exact over Q, no irrational coordinates. Decides strict and non-strict inequalities, universals, and equality-witness conjunctions (e.g. x-3=0 and x^2-3x+2>0 is true; x-2=0 and x^2-3x+2>0 is false). This is a genuine DECISION (not a certificate to supply), a real step beyond last turn's checker. Example 397 + golden cas_realqe.
- Extended `src/cas/tptp/core.lisp` with a `real-qe` goal shape routing univariate real statements to the decision procedure (theorem / countersat -- it decides). Existing routes unchanged; bridge golden extended.
- Zero regressions; structure and lint clean. The multivariate case (full CAD with projection/lifting) is named as the frontier ahead.

# CAS frontier: the constrained Positivstellensatz (and wiring it into the TPTP-arith bridge)

- Added `src/cas/positivstellensatz.lisp`: CONSTRAINED positivity certificates -- proving p >= 0 on a semialgebraic set S = {g_i >= 0} by a weighted-SOS (Positivstellensatz/Putinar) certificate p = sigma_0 + sum_i sigma_i g_i with every sigma_j a sum of squares. Sound by construction (on S the RHS is manifestly >= 0); verified exactly over Q by checking the polynomial identity and that each sigma_j is SOS (decided for univariate sigma_j via sos.lisp). Verified: x>=0 on {x-1>=0} (sigma_0=1,sigma_1=1); x^2-1>=0 on {x-1>=0} (sigma_0=(x-1)^2,sigma_1=2); rejects a non-SOS multiplier (the false x-3>=0 on {x-1>=0}, which fails at x=1) and a broken identity, each with a named reason; empty constraints reduce to plain SOS. Like SOS this CERTIFIES, not DECIDES (finding multipliers is a semidefinite search). Example 396 + golden cas_positivstellensatz.
- Extended `src/cas/tptp/core.lisp` with a `nonneg-on-set` goal shape that routes constrained-nonnegativity goals ("for all x in S, p(x) >= 0") to the Positivstellensatz checker: 'theorem with a valid certificate, 'unknown without (never falsely refuted). Existing routes unchanged (additive). Golden cas_tptparith extended for coverage.
- This is the frontier rung directly above unconstrained SOS, and it makes the bridge able to settle guarded arithmetic goals. Zero regressions; structure and lint clean.

# CAS frontier: multivariate SOS certificates + a TPTP-arithmetic bridge (side project)

MAIN FRONTIER
- Added `src/cas/sosmv.lisp`: MULTIVARIATE sum-of-squares certificates of global nonnegativity -- a sound, one-directional positivity proof. If p = sum q_i^2 then p >= 0 everywhere; the module verifies such a decomposition exactly over Q (expanding with mpoly arithmetic) and reports the residual when a candidate is wrong, never claiming "p is not nonnegative" (the converse fails by Motzkin). Includes the Gauss product identity. Verified: (x+y)^2 certifies x^2+2xy+y^2; {x,y} certifies x^2+y^2; the Motzkin polynomial is acknowledged nonnegative-but-not-SOS (no false certificate). Example 394 + golden cas_sosmv.

SIDE PROJECT (started inside Sangaku, splittable later)
- Added `src/cas/tptp/core.lisp`: the TPTP-ARITHMETIC BRIDGE. A classifier + router taking an arithmetic goal and dispatching it to the right Sangaku decider with that decider's certificate: contradictory polynomial systems -> Nullstellensatz ('theorem with refuting basis); polynomial identities -> exact check; univariate universal inequalities -> SOS DECISION; multivariate -> SOS certificate ('theorem with witness, 'unknown without -- never falsely refuted); ground comparisons -> direct evaluation; everything else -> 'outside-fragment. Sound by construction. Honest scope: Sangaku is not a FOF/CNF saturation prover; this is the certificate-carrying arithmetic niche. Consumes goals from the tptptp parser lowered to normalized forms. Example 395 + golden cas_tptparith.
- Made check-structure.sh and find-orphans.sh recurse into src/cas subdirectories (for the new tptp/ submodule tree).
- Zero regressions; structure and lint clean.

# CAS frontier — the Nullstellensatz decision procedure (and a bridge toward automated theorem proving)

- Added `src/cas/nullstellensatz.lisp`: Sangaku's first genuine DECISION PROCEDURE. By Hilbert's Weak Nullstellensatz, a polynomial system f_1=...=f_m=0 is unsatisfiable over the algebraic closure iff 1 is in the ideal, iff the reduced Groebner basis contains a nonzero constant. nss-decide returns 'unsatisfiable | 'satisfiable; nss-refutes? gives the refutation; nss-verify-refutation re-checks the certificate (1 and each generator reduce to 0 against the basis). This is the algebraic analogue of deriving FALSE from hypotheses -- the shape of an arithmetic theorem-proving (TPTP) goal, with the Groebner basis as proof.
- Verified: {x, x-1} and {xy-1, x} unsatisfiable (refutations verify); {x-5}, {x^2+y^2-1, x-2} (complex solution), and {} satisfiable.
- Caught a real bug during construction: normal-forming the constant 1 against a basis hung when exponent vectors had differing lengths; replaced with direct detection of a nonzero constant in the reduced basis (the clean Nullstellensatz test), which is robust and faster.
- Honest scope: decides satisfiability over the algebraically CLOSED field; real solvability (Positivstellensatz) and full first-order logic are named as separate, harder problems, not conflated.
- Added example 392 and golden cas_nullstellensatz. Zero regressions; structure and lint clean.

# CAS — axiom mode (simpler proving UX) + the ramified-place integral element (frontier pushed harder)

- Added `lib/cas/axmode.lisp`: an AXIOM MODE for lightweight theorem proving. Load axioms once (ax-assume facts, ax-assume-rule rules, ax-assume-not negative facts), then ax-check any statement for a three-valued verdict: proven (derivable), disproven (negation derivable -- never from mere absence), or independent (neither). A contradictory axiom set is flagged 'inconsistent. Built on logic.lisp's Horn-clause engine, so the verdicts are exactly the trusted engine's. From {human(socrates), mortal(X):-human(X)}: mortal(socrates) proven, mortal(zeus) independent, then disproven once (not (mortal zeus)) is added; multi-step ancestry resolved.
- Added `lib/cas/ramplace.lisp`: the RAMIFIED-PLACE integral element on y^2 = f, the local integral-closure generator at a cusp (a root of f of multiplicity m >= 2, where the branch is a Puiseux series in a fractional power) -- harder than the multi-branch node case. At x=a the valuations are v(x-a)=2, v(y)=m; the element w = y/(x-a)^floor(m/2) is integral with w^2 = f/(x-a)^{2 floor(m/2)} a polynomial (monic minimal polynomial certificate). Verified: cusp y^2=x^3 -> y/x, w^2=x (ramified); y^2=x^5 -> y/x^2, w^2=x; y^2=(x-1)^3 at x=1; even multiplicity y^2=x^2 splits (w a unit); a non-root point is unramified-regular. Place classified ramified/split/unramified-regular (local Riemann-Hurwitz data).
- Added examples 390 (axiom mode) and 391 (ramified place) and their goldens, with soundness controls (inconsistent set flagged; non-root yields no element).
- Updated the comparison with the two new rows; the roadmap's integral-closure horizon now reads: finite squarefree + nodes + ramified hyperelliptic places done; general-degree ramification and infinite places open.
- Zero regressions across the logic, integral-closure, and theorem-proving chains.

# CAS as theorem prover — certified definite integrals and the Dirichlet/sinc integral = pi/2

- Added `lib/cas/defint.lisp`: CERTIFIED DEFINITE INTEGRALS by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. For a polynomial integrand, computes the antiderivative F, discharges "F is an antiderivative of f" with the differentiation arbiter, evaluates F(b)-F(a) exactly, and emits a re-checkable proof record (a tampered value fails re-check). INT_0^1 x^2 = 1/3, INT_0^2 (3x^2+2x+1) = 14, etc., each a theorem.
- Added `lib/cas/dirichlet.lisp`: the Dirichlet integral INT_0^inf sin(x)/x dx = pi/2 (the sinc value), proved by the parameter-integral (Feynman) method -- NOT by an antiderivative (the integrand is non-elementary). I(s)=INT_0^inf e^{-sx} sin x/x dx; I'(s)=-INT e^{-sx} sin x=-1/(s^2+1) (Lemma A, Laplace transform certified from its antiderivative); I(s)=C-arctan(s) (Lemma B, arctan-derivative certified); boundary gives C=pi/2; I(0)=pi/2. The transcendental lemmas are certified by exact-agreement-at-samples; the algebraic backbone is exact; the proof record re-checks.
- Caught a real reader bug during construction: a quoted symbol containing parentheses (laplace-sine=1/(s^2+1)) broke the s-expression reader though the parens balanced lexically; fixed by removing the embedded parens from the symbol name.
- Added examples 388 (definite-integral theorems) and 389 (sinc/Dirichlet theorem) and their goldens, including soundness controls (tampered records rejected).
- The honest division of labor: the FTC case (defint) and the non-elementary parameter-integral case (dirichlet) are kept distinct, naming which arbiter certifies which step.
- Updated the comparison with the two theorem-proving rows. Zero regressions.

# CAS frontier — multi-branch combined integral element (general-curve integral closure)

- Added `lib/cas/vanhoeijmb.lisp`: the MULTI-BRANCH combined-correction integral element on y^2 = f, building and certifying an integral-basis element w = (A + B y)/d that is integral at a place where several branches meet at once -- the case vanhoeij.lisp deferred as 'needs-place-combination. Found by the exact integral-closure test in K = Q(x)[y]/(y^2-f): w is integral iff its minimal polynomial w^2 - (2A/d)w + (A^2-B^2f)/d^2 has polynomial coefficients (trace and norm both divide out). The norm sees all branches, certifying integrality everywhere simultaneously.
- Verified: at the node y^2=x^2(x+1) the element y/x (trace 0, norm -(x+1)) is the combined-branch element; at the two-node y^2=x^2(x-1)^2(x+1) the element y/(x(x-1)) is integral at both; non-integral candidates (y/x^2, y/(x-1) at a smooth point) are rejected with the failing trace/norm exhibited.
- Caught a zero-representation bug during construction: the certificate compared () vs (0) for the zero trace polynomial; fixed by comparing trimmed forms.
- Added example 387 and golden cas_vanhoeijmb with full coverage including the rejection controls.
- Updated the comparison (new multi-branch row) and roadmap (the integral-closure horizon now reads: finite squarefree + multi-branch nodes done; ramified and infinite places open).
- Zero regressions across the integral-closure, superelliptic, and aperiodicity chains.

# CAS last rung closed — unconditional aperiodicity proof for the third-kind integral

- Added `lib/cas/hyperaperiodic.lisp`: an UNCONDITIONAL certificate that y^2 = f has no Pell unit -- hence that INT dx/sqrt(f) is non-elementary -- by traversing the full cycle of complete quotients of the continued fraction of sqrt(f) until a pair (P_i, Q_i) repeats. A closed cycle with no nonzero-constant Q (past the trivial start) is a finite PROOF of non-elementarity, converting polycf's bounded "aperiodic-up-to-B" into a real theorem. Both directions of the third-kind elementarity decision are now closed: periodic gives the explicit logarithm, proven-aperiodic gives non-elementarity.
- Cross-checked by independent agreement: y^2=x^6+1 has the unit (x^3,1) (elementary, torsion), y^2=x^6+x^2+1 closes its cycle with no unit (proven non-elementary, non-torsion) and the bounded polycf search independently agrees (aperiodic up to 100). x^6+x^4+1 and x^6+x+2 likewise proven non-elementary.
- Caught a subtle bug during construction: the trivial first complete quotient (P_0,Q_0)=(0,1) has Q_0=1 constant by construction and must be excluded from the unit test (else every curve looks periodic); the test runs over the tail of the cycle only.
- Added example 386 and golden cas_hyperaperiodic with full coverage including the elementary/non-elementary split and the bounded-vs-unconditional cross-check.
- The Trager ladder now shows zero open rungs: every rung has a sound certified core, with the full third-kind construction at summit and the genuine research horizon (uniform period bound per genus) named honestly in the roadmap.
- Zero regressions across the Pell, continued-fraction, Jacobian-torsion, and hyperelliptic chains.

# CAS frontier — hardening the Pell unit engine: square guard + reverse-CF cross-check

- Added a perfect-square guard and explicit unit classification to `lib/cas/polycf.lisp`: pcf-is-square? flags curves where sqrt(f) is a polynomial (no Pell unit), and pcf-unit-status returns one of 'square / (unit A B) / 'unit-unverified / 'no-unit-up-to -- so every verdict is explicit rather than a degenerate unit-unverified. Verified x^4+2x^2+1=(x^2+1)^2 is flagged 'square.
- Added a reverse-CF round-trip cross-check (example 385): a unit (A,B) with constant norm c determines f=(A^2-c)/B^2, and the continued fraction of that f must independently recover a certified unit. This validates the unit-finder against the opposite construct-from-unit direction -- two independent methods agreeing. Verified the engineered curve x^6+2x^4+3x^2+2 from (x^4+x^2+1, x, 1) is recovered by the CF with exactly that nonconstant-B unit, plus several further engineered units round-tripping.
- Over Q, polynomial Pell with period >= 3 is rare (none found in a wide small-coefficient scan), so the reverse-CF construction is the rigorous validator of the convergent/norm machinery beyond period 1.
- Added golden cas_pellcrosscheck; existing cas_polycf golden unaffected (additive functions).
- Updated the comparison with one new capability row.
- Zero regressions across the polycf, Pell, third-kind, and algebraic chains; every positive result certified.

# CAS frontier — period-2 Pell units fixed, and a CF-driven third-kind construction for any periodic curve

- Fixed a convergent/iteration-indexing bug in `lib/cas/polycf.lisp`: the Abel recurrence must start from the state AFTER a0 (P_1 = a0, Q_1 = f - a0^2), not from (P=0, Q=1) which recomputed a0 and shifted every partial quotient. With the fix, genuine period-2 curves certify: y^2 = x^6 + x now has period 2 and a certified fundamental unit (2x^6+1+..., 2x^2) of constant norm, where before it was honestly deferred as unit-unverified. The period-1 family (incl. f=h^2+c) is regression-clean. Updated example 383 and golden cas_polycf to reflect the period-2 certification.
- Added `lib/cas/hyperpellcf.lisp`: the CF-driven genus-2 third-kind Pell construction. Given ANY hyperelliptic curve y^2 = f, it asks polycf for the certified fundamental unit (A,B), builds g0 = A + B y in the genus-agnostic field (algfunc), and produces INT ((g0^n)'/g0^n) = log(g0^n), each gated by the differentiation certificate. Generalizes hyperpell past the f=h^2+c family to every periodic curve, including genuine period-2. Verified on y^2=x^6+x (period 2, not h^2+c) for n=1,2,3, agreement with hyperpell on x^6+1, and an honest no-unit for a non-periodic curve.
- Added example 384 and golden cas_hyperpellcf with full coverage including the soundness control.
- Updated the comparison (one new row) and the Trager ladder (the open third-kind rung now records the CF-driven construction and period-2; longer periods at higher genus remain).
- Zero regressions across the polycf, Pell, third-kind, and algebraic chains; every positive result certified.

# CAS frontier — the continued fraction of sqrt(f): deciding a hyperelliptic curve's Pell unit

- Added `lib/cas/polycf.lisp`: the continued fraction of sqrt(f) over Q[x] (Abel's algorithm), with periodicity detection and the fundamental-unit convergent -- the function-field analogue of the numeric CF for sqrt(N). Computes polypart(sqrt f) by coefficient matching, iterates the complete-quotient recurrence, detects periodicity (Q returns to a constant), and reads the fundamental Pell unit off the convergent. Every unit is gated by its norm A^2-B^2 f being a nonzero constant (pcf-certify-unit, pcf-unit-verified): the period-1 family (incl. f=h^2+c) is fully certified; higher even periods return unit-unverified (never a wrong unit); curves not closing within the bound return no-unit-up-to (honest bounded negative). Verified the certified units of x^6+1 (x^3,1 norm -1), (x^3+x)^2+2, the genus-0 x^2+1, and the honest deferrals for x^6+x (period 2) and x^6+x^2+1 (aperiodic in bound). This lets the genus-2 third-kind Pell construction work for curves where the unit is not visible by inspection.
- Fixed a convergent-indexing bug found during testing (the fundamental unit uses the first L quotients a_0..a_{L-1}, not the period-closing quotient); caught because the unit norm was non-constant, then verified against hyperpell.
- Added example 383 and golden cas_polycf with full coverage including the soundness deferrals.
- Updated the comparison with one new capability row.
- Zero regressions across the Pell, third-kind, algebraic, and continued-fraction chains; every positive result certified.

# CAS frontier — genus-2 nonconstant-B third-kind via the function-field Pell unit

- Added `lib/cas/hyperpell.lisp`: the genus-2 nonconstant-B third-kind construction. On the family f = h^2 + c the element g0 = h + y is a fundamental unit (constant norm -c); its powers g0^n = A_n + B_n y have B_n nonconstant (n>=2) and norm (-c)^n, each a third-kind logarithm argument INT ((g0^n)'/g0^n) = log(g0^n), certified by the norm relation AND by differentiation in the field (algfunc, genus-agnostic). For deg h = 3 these are genuine genus-2 curves. Verified on y^2=x^6+1 (unit x^3+y, norm -1; g0^2=(2x^6+1,2x^3); g0^3), a second curve (x^3+x)^2+2, and a non-unit rejection. This is the genus-2 companion to the genus-0 elliptic3pell construction, completing the third-kind construction past the a+y shape at genus 2.
- Added example 382 and golden cas_hyperpell with full coverage including the soundness control.
- Updated the comparison (one new genus-2 row) and the Trager ladder (the open third-kind rung now records nonconstant-B at genus 2 via the Pell unit; arbitrary genus / non-periodic sqrt(f) remain).
- Zero regressions across the third-kind, algebraic, and hyperelliptic chains; every positive result certified.

# CAS frontier — genus-2 third-kind logarithm + unified hyperelliptic integration driver

- Added `lib/cas/hyperthird.lisp`: the genus-2 (and general hyperelliptic) third-kind logarithm INT (g'/g) dx = log(g) for g = a(x)+y on y^2=f. Reuses algfunc (genus-agnostic field/derivation) and the tested esp-poly-sqrt; recovers a from the differential's denominator via the norm a^2-f, certifies by the cleared identity (a+y)*omega = D(a+y). Verified on y^2=x^5+1 (a=x, x^2, x^2+1), soundness rejection, and the genus-1 cross-check. Generalizes sethird to arbitrary-genus hyperelliptic. Advances the full third-kind construction into genus 2.
- Added `lib/cas/hyperint.lisp`: the unified hyperelliptic integration driver -- one entry point that dispatches the second-kind (hyperell: elementary Q sqrt(f) or first-kind non-elementarity proof) and third-kind (hyperthird: logarithm) cases over y^2=f at any genus, returning a single certified verdict. Verified second-kind elementary + non-elementary, third-kind logarithm, honest non-recognition, and identical decisions across genus 1 and 2. Advances the general algebraic Risch for the hyperelliptic family.
- During development, caught a bug in a from-scratch polynomial square root (failed on arguments with intermediate terms) and fixed it by reusing the already-tested esp-poly-sqrt rather than duplicating the algorithm.
- Added examples 380-381 and goldens with full coverage including soundness controls.
- Updated the comparison (two new genus-2 rows) and the Trager ladder (the open third-kind rung now records the explicit genus-2 logarithm; arguments beyond a+y and arbitrary genus remain).
- Zero regressions across the algebraic, third-kind, and hyperelliptic chains; every positive result certified.

# CAS third-kind frontier — the genus-2 Jacobian: group law + torsion-based elementarity decision

- Added `lib/cas/hyperjac.lisp`: the Jacobian group law of a genus-2 hyperelliptic curve y^2=f (deg 5) by Mumford representation and Cantor's algorithm (composition + reduction over Q[x], with a from-scratch extended gcd). The identity [1,0], points [x-a,b], negation [u,-v], addition, doubling, scalar multiples; every result certified by the Mumford curve condition u | (v^2-f). Verified P+0=P, P+Q=[x^2+x,x+1] on y^2=x^5+1, P+(-P)=0, and Weierstrass 2-torsion.
- Added `lib/cas/hyperjactor.lisp`: the genus-2 third-kind torsion decision -- the genus-2 analogue of the elliptic order test. The class [P]-[iota P] is elementary iff torsion; computed as the order of P under the Jacobian group law by bounded search, reporting (torsion n) or an HONEST (no-torsion-up-to B) -- never a false non-elementary claim. Verified a Weierstrass point is order 2, (0,1) on y^2=x^5+1 is order 5 (elementary), the soundness bounded-miss, and a cross-check on y^2=x^5-x.
- Added examples 378-379 and goldens with full coverage including the soundness controls.
- Updated the comparison and the Trager ladder: two new genus-2 capability rows; the open third-kind rung now records genus-2 progress (group law + torsion decision done; explicit genus-2 logarithm and arbitrary genus remain).
- Zero regressions across the third-kind, algebraic, and RUNG-5 chains; every positive result certified.

# CAS RUNG 5 — stacked algebraic towers: the field of x^(1/4) and its third-kind logarithm

- Added `lib/cas/algtower2.lisp`: a tower of two algebraic extensions Q(x)[y][z]/(z^2-y, y^2-x), the field of x^(1/4). Element arithmetic (z^2->y reduction) and the certified derivation D(a+bz) = a' + (b' + b/(4x))z, reducing soundly to algfunc's inner derivation plus the scalar z'/z = 1/(4x). Verified z^2=y, z^4=x, y'=y/(2x), and INT (5/4)x^(1/4) = x^(5/4) by differentiation in the tower.
- Added `lib/cas/algtower2log.lisp`: the field inverse (via the outer conjugate, one inner inverse) and the third-kind logarithm INT (e'/e) dx = log(e), certified by the inverse-free cleared identity e*(e'/e) = D(e). Verified log(1+x^(1/4)), log(x^(1/4)), log(sqrt x), with sound rejection of non-logarithmic differentials.
- Added examples 376-377 and goldens with full coverage including soundness controls.
- Corrected the comparison chart: the algebraic-Risch frontier (previously a single stale 'none') is now split into the nine certified sub-capabilities actually built (hyperelliptic decision, algebraic Hermite, genus-1 elliptic logs, Puiseux/integral basis, superelliptic family, van Hoeij, mixed towers, the double tower), leaving exactly ONE honest 'none' row: general algebraic Risch at arbitrary genus/tower, the open summit. The two height-two 'none' rows are corrected to 'part' (single-residue cases certified; only the general multi-residue x-dependent case is memory-bound).
- Zero regressions across the algebraic and RUNG-5 chains; every positive result certified by differentiation.

# CAS frontier — genus-0 algebraic integration (first rung of the algebraic-case Risch problem)

- Added `lib/cas/algquadint.lisp`: the genus-0 algebraic integral INT (px+r)/sqrt(ax^2+bx+c) dx, the first rung of the algebraic-case Risch frontier (where lizard was at 'none' and even Maxima only 'part'). The linear numerator splits into a certified algebraic (second-kind) part (p/2a) sqrt(q) plus a first-kind part: a logarithm (arcsinh form) when a>0, an arcsine when a<0 with the radicand having real roots. Every closed form certified by differentiation; integrands with no real form reported 'no-real-form. The arcsine condition (a<0 AND discriminant>0, argument (2ax+b)/sqrt D) was derived and verified via D-(2ax+b)^2 = -4a q.
- Added example 374 and golden cas_algquadint with full coverage (log case, pure-algebraic case, mixed case, two arcsine cases, and the honest no-real-form control).
- Implemented from the published algorithms (Euler substitution, classical first/second-kind reduction) from scratch with certificates -- not adapted from any GPL source.
- Zero regressions across the elliptic, hyperelliptic, Hermite, and rational-integration chains.

# CAS ladder — three rungs climbed: complex tuples, superelliptic integral basis, F4 reduction

- Added `lib/cas/cplxtuples.lisp`: complete complex solution tuples over the Gaussian rationals Q(i). Gaussian-rational arithmetic (gr-), perfect-square detection turning a (complex re im2) into its two Q(i) roots, triangular-system assembly into complete complex points, certified by evaluating every generator to zero in Q(i). Non-rational imaginary parts reported 'not-gaussian. Climbs the complex-coordinates ladder rung.
- Added `lib/cas/superintbasis.lisp`: the integral basis at the finite places of a superelliptic curve y^n = f. For squarefree f the certified power basis {1, y, ..., y^(n-1)}, each element integral via its monic defining polynomial t^n - f^k, with discriminant n^n f^(n-1) and maximality decided by the squarefree test; non-squarefree f reported non-maximal with the repeated factor. Climbs the degree>2 integral-closure ladder rung.
- Added `lib/cas/groebnerf4.lisp`: the linear-algebra reduction at the heart of F4. A Macaulay matrix (columns = monomials sorted descending, rows = polynomials) is row-reduced to RREF over Q; the nonzero rows read back are the reductions, pivot columns the leading monomials. Exact over Q, with row-space preservation certified. Climbs the F4-class-engine ladder rung.
- Added examples 371-373 and their goldens with full coverage including honest-deferral controls.
- Updated the three infographics: the Trager ladder now shows a single remaining open rung (the full third-kind / Jacobian-torsion construction), with the three climbed rungs at summit; the comparison and roadmap reflect the new certified capabilities.
- Zero regressions across the Groebner, superelliptic, and complex chains; every positive result certified.

# CAS summit — exponential single-logarithm completion + open-source surface

- Added `lib/cas/tower2expfull.lisp`: the exponential single-logarithm recognizer that completes the proper-fraction branch of the height-two exponential integrator. A squarefree remainder As/Ds is recognized as the single logarithm c·log(Ds) exactly when As = c·D2(Ds) for a tower constant c, found by one polynomial division over K1[theta2] (no Sylvester resultant) and certified by differentiation. This closes the case the unified driver's power-sum wrapper previously rejected whenever the denominator was squarefree but not a bare power theta2^j (e.g. theta2 - e^x), promoting the exponential second-monomial capability from partial to a genuine integrator on the single-log case. The multi-residue x-dependent RootSum continues to route through the dedicated fraction-free resultant integrator (`tower2expff.lisp`) to avoid memory blow-up.
- Added `examples/370-exponential-single-log.lisp` and `tests/cas_tower2expfull.expected` with full coverage including the honest-deferral control (`notrecognized`).
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` documenting the build/test commands, library-module structure, the per-feature workflow (verify-first, additive-safety grep, module + example + golden + docs), and the certificate-and-honest-scope discipline.
- Corrected stale counts in `README.md` (now 271 library modules, ~26,000 lines of Lisp, 371 examples) and fixed a dead documentation link (`docs/ROADMAP.md` -> the actual `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` and `docs/TRAGER_ROADMAP.md`); added a `CONTRIBUTING.md` pointer.
- Zero regressions across the height-two tower and the CAS chains; every positive result remains certified by differentiation.

# Phase 3F — tokenizer source wrapper + explicit GC metadata classification

- Fixed `lizard_tokenize_source` link failure by implementing the tokenizer-source wrapper declared in `tokenizer.h`.
- Source-tokenization diagnostics now preserve caller-provided filenames instead of always reporting `<string>`.
- Added `lizard_heap_alloc_tagged` so constructors can register explicit GC object kinds instead of relying only on size inference.
- Refactored core AST/list-node constructors in `mem.c` to use explicit GC metadata classification.
- Extended GC metadata stats with per-kind counters.
- Added tokenizer source diagnostic regression coverage.
- Extended ownership audit to require explicit GC classification scaffolding.
- Kept collector behavior non-moving and unchanged.

# Phase 3A — object model / value ownership audit

- Added `src/object_model.c` / `src/object_model.h` with ownership and tracing-policy metadata for heap, C-owned, borrowed, static, and context-owned objects.
- Added `tests/object_model_test.c`.
- Added `scripts/check-ownership-audit.py` and `make ownership-audit`.
- Wired `ownership-audit` into `make ci`.
- Added `docs/OWNERSHIP.md` documenting current ownership rules and the object-level non-moving GC transition target.
- Kept allocator/GC behavior unchanged; this is a strict metadata/audit scaffold.

# Phase 2Y — include graph / layering audit

- Added `scripts/check-include-layers.py` to audit public/internal header layering.
- Added `make include-audit` and wired it into `make ci`.
- Added `docs/INCLUDE_LAYERS.md` describing the public API, wrapper, implementation-root, tooling-leaf, and implementation-header layers.
- The include audit detects public headers leaking private headers, implementation headers including the public wrapper, parent-relative includes, selected leaf headers depending on the interpreter core, and cycles in the `src/*.h` quoted include graph.
- Kept all strict/security warning flags intact.

# Phase 2X — syntax/header boundary audit

- Fixed the `surface_term.h` include-order regression by requiring the header to
  include `lizard_api.h` before exposing `lizard_expansion_trace_event_t`.
- Added `scripts/check-header-boundaries.sh` to scan `src/*.h` for public API
  types and verify direct `lizard_api.h` inclusion.
- Added `make header-audit` and wired it into `make ci`.
- Kept all strict/security warning flags intact; no warning suppressions added.

# Changelog

## Documentation refresh + proof-producing CAS

- Rewrote `README.md` to reflect the current state: the four research
  tracks (R/C/K/Q, all feature-complete at the library level), the
  45-module standard library, the self-hosting demos, and bignum
  performance (within ~200ms of MIT Scheme on the 123^12312 loop).
- Added `docs/USAGE.md` — a getting-started guide and library recipes.
- Added `docs/CAS.md` — the proof-producing / verified CAS architecture
  and a roadmap connecting the CAS to the trusted kernel and ZFC.
- New `lib/cas.lisp` — symbolic algebra: simplification, differentiation
  (constant/variable/sum/product/quotient/power/chain + sin/cos/exp/ln),
  and basic polynomial integration.
- New `lib/cas-proof.lisp` — a layered foundation database (ZFC axioms →
  real construction → field axioms → limits → derivative → calculus
  rules), derivation trees with rule citations, and unfolding of any
  CAS result down to the ZFC axioms it rests on.
- New examples 125 (symbolic CAS) and 126 (a derivative unfolded to ZFC).

# Lizard v5 — engineering infrastructure (in progress)

This section logs the major infrastructure work built on top of the v4
type-theory + diagnostics baseline.

## Phase 0: Runtime refactor (B.1–B.2)

- Added `lizard_runtime_t *runtime` back-pointer on `lizard_heap_t`, so
  any function holding the heap can reach runtime state via `heap->runtime`.
- Moved 9 process-global variables into `lizard_runtime_t`:
  `gensym_counter`, `sr_counter`, `callcc_buf/active/value`,
  `logic_config_head`, `logic_last_set_bundle`, `hit_registry_head`,
  `flag_list`.
- Accessor functions (`logic_config_ptr()`, etc.) with static fallbacks
  for backward compat with standalone heaps.
- Sequential multi-instance now works: two runtimes in the same process
  have independent logic configs, HIT registries, and counters.

## Phase C: Module loader

- `(import "path.lisp")` — load once with caching, resolved via search path.
- `(module-loaded? "path")`, `(module-search-path)`, `(add-module-path! "dir")`.
- Default search path includes `lib/`. Module cache keyed by both raw
  and resolved paths.

## Phase D: Garbage collector (D.1–D.3)

- `gc_mark` bit on every `lizard_ast_node_t`. `lizard_heap_alloc` zeroes
  memory to ensure marks start at 0.
- `lizard_gc_mark_node` — recursive mark traversal covering 80+ AST types.
- `lizard_gc_mark_env` — walks environment chains and closure captures.
- Segment-level sweep: `lizard_gc_collect` frees heap segments with zero
  live objects. No pointer updating needed.
- `(gc)` — run mark + sweep, report freed bytes and before/after stats.
- `(gc-stats)` — report segments, bytes, total/live/garbage node counts.

## Phase E: Bytecode compiler + VM (E.1–E.2)

- 30-opcode stack-based VM (`src/bytecode.h`, `src/bytecode.c`).
- Compiler handles: constants, variables, arithmetic, comparisons,
  if/else, define/set!, lambda with closures, general function calls,
  begin, cons/car/cdr, display/newline.
- **Tail-call optimization**: `OP_TAIL_CALL` replaces the current frame
  (chunk, env, ip, sp) and restarts the dispatch loop. Zero C stack growth.
- `(vm-eval expr)`, `(disassemble expr)`, `(vm-time expr)`, `(time-eval expr)`.

## Profiler

- `(profile expr)` — compile + execute with full instruction counting.
  Reports: elapsed time, total instructions, call/tail-call counts,
  MIPS, and per-opcode breakdown.

## Structured diagnostics (Phase F)

- `lizard_make_error_at(heap, code, span)` — error with source location.
- Six key eval error paths carry spans (unbound symbol, invalid apply,
  bad define, bad assignment).
- Error printer prepends `line:col:` when span is available.
- `(error-location err)` — programmatic access to error span.

## Documentation

- `docs/HIT.md` — comprehensive HIT layer reference (~350 lines).
- `docs/MODAL.md` — updated with full M.5.* coverage.
- `DESIGN.md` — added "Further documentation" index.
- `docs/CLAIMS_MATRIX.md` — updated throughout.

# Lizard v4 — type-theory expansion + diagnostics/scaffolds (in progress)

This section logs the changes from v3 (post-restructure baseline) to the current
head. The v3 section follows. For per-phase detail, see `DESIGN.md`, `docs/MODAL.md`,
`docs/CLAIMS_MATRIX.md`, and `docs/OPTIONAL_PROOF_SCAFFOLDS.md`.

## Public/internal header split

- `include/lizard.h` is now a 13-line compatibility shim re-exporting
  `include/lizard_api.h`. All AST node definitions and interpreter internals
  moved to `src/lizard_internal.h`.
- Embedders get a stable opaque public surface. Internals can evolve without
  ABI breaks. Older embedders that `#include <lizard.h>` keep working.

## Source spans on every AST node

- `lizard_source_span_t span` field on each `lizard_ast_node_t`.
- Tokens already carried `line`/`column`/`offset`; this propagates them
  forward into the AST so diagnostics can point at the right place in source.
- Foundation for future structured error messages.

## Scaffold/checked discipline

- New convention: experimental syntax lives behind opt-in **logic rules** and
  is documented as "scaffold" in `docs/CLAIMS_MATRIX.md` until promoted to
  "checked" status.
- New bundles: `cubical-S1`, `truncations`, `proof-scaffold`.
- New toggles: `cubical-s1-enabled`, `truncations-enabled`,
  `theory-extensions-enabled`.
- Documented migration path in `docs/OPTIONAL_PROOF_SCAFFOLDS.md`.

## Phase H.2 — Propositional truncation promoted from scaffold to checked

- AST nodes `Trunc`, `trunc`, `trunc-elim` (originally scaffold) now have real
  typing rules and a primary computation rule.
- Typing:
  - `(Trunc level A) : Universe-of-A` — universe-preserving.
  - `(trunc x) : (Trunc A)` infers `A` from `x : A`; level left NULL.
  - `(trunc-elim C h e) : C` when `e : (Trunc _ A)` and `h : Π _:A. C`.
- Reduction: `(trunc-elim C h (trunc x)) ⟶ (@ h x)`, deterministic.
- Honest gap: propositionality obligation on motive `C` not structurally
  enforced (see `docs/CLAIMS_MATRIX.md`).
- All operations gated on `truncations-enabled`.
- New test `tests/tt_truncation_test.c`, walkthrough `examples/62-truncation.lisp`.

## Cubical S¹ scaffold (unchanged from upload)

- `S1`, `base`, `loop` with minimal typing spine.
- Remains scaffold-only — no recursor, no `loop`-computation rule, no
  Kan composition.

## Type-theory work prior to H.2 (carried forward from earlier v4 state)

- Lambda cube (M.2, M.3): 8 cube corners + CoC as named bundles.
- Substructural rules (M.4): `weakening`/`contraction`/`exchange` toggles.
- Universe lattice (L.1–L.5): pi-fresh/co-pi-fresh, couniverse, lattice toggles.
- HIT scaffolding (H.1): AST nodes + registry, no computation rules.
- Modal logic layer (M.5.1–M.5.9): K, T, S4, S5 operationally distinct;
  asymmetric forms (box/unbox/diamond/let-diamond/box-app/diamond-bind);
  **symmetric S5 (M.5.9 Turn 2b)**: `dia`, `poss-coerce`, judgment-kind
  tracking, kind propagation through `let-diamond`, kind check in `box-intro`.
  See `docs/MODAL.md`.

## Diagnostics and proof-scaffold infrastructure (community contribution)

- `docs/CLAIMS_MATRIX.md` — precise feature status (implemented / partial /
  scaffold / not implemented), updated whenever a feature changes tier.
- `docs/OPTIONAL_PROOF_SCAFFOLDS.md` — explains the scaffold/checked
  discipline and the intended migration path.
- `tests/tt_optional_extensions.lisp` + `.expected` — golden test for the
  new opt-in nodes at the construction layer.
- Enhanced `runtime.c/h` and `lizard_api.h` for richer embedding surface.
- Generic `theory-extension` AST node (scaffold) for plugging in
  experiments without changing the AST.

## Scoreboard at v4 head (after H.2 + merge)

```
57 C unit tests + 5 Lisp golden tests passing
62+ examples including modal layer (M.5.*) walkthroughs and H.2 truncation
Benchmark: ~0.5s
Builds clean: release, debug, asan, coverage

# Lizard v3 — restructure + tests + features

## Structural changes

- **`src/` + `include/` split.** All implementation in `src/`, single
  public header `include/lizard.h`. The public header no longer
  pulls in internal `errors.h`/`en.h`/`lang.h`; those become true
  internals and are included only by the `.c` files that need them.
- **`tests/` directory** with:
  - A header-only test harness (`test_harness.h`).
  - A façade (`test_helpers.{h,c}`) that gives each test one line to
    spin up a fresh interpreter and another to evaluate strings.
  - Five C unit tests (`arith_test`, `control_test`, `lambda_test`,
    `lists_test`, `macros_test`).
  - Two golden-output tests (`scripting`, `error_propagation`) with
    matching `.expected` files.
- **`examples/`** unchanged in content but now formally part of the
  layout (with a README of its own).
- **`tests/tests.mk`** included from the top-level Makefile gives
  `make test`, `make test-c`, `make test-lisp`, plus colourised
  PASS/FAIL output per test.
- **`lizard_install_primitives()`** moved from `repl.c` into the
  library so tests and the REPL share one source of truth for the
  set of registered built-ins.

## New features

- **`display`**, **`write`**, **`newline`** primitives — standard
  Scheme I/O so `.lisp` scripts can produce real output rather than
  relying on the REPL's auto-echo.
- **`(load "path")`** primitive — reads a file and evaluates every
  top-level form in the current environment. Reports proper errors
  (`LIZARD_ERROR_LOAD_ARGC`, `_ARGT`, `_OPEN`, `_READ`). Lets
  scripts depend on the prelude:
  ```lisp
  (load "examples/prelude.lisp")
  (display (sum (range 1 101))) (newline)   ; 5050
  ```

## Bugs fixed since the user's snapshot

The upload had the begin/macro fixes but reverted several others. This
release re-applies them on top of the upload's structural improvements
(typedef aliases, `lizard_make_number_copy`, `static` globals,
`lizard_repl_strdup`):

1. **Tokenizer treats all whitespace as whitespace.** `\t`, `\n`, `\r`
   are skipped; previously only `' '` was, so any multi-line file with
   tabs or newlines tokenised into garbage symbols.
2. **`;` line comments** are recognised by the tokenizer.
3. **REPL is stdin-friendly.** When stdin is not a TTY the prompt,
   raw-mode line editor, and `\033[K` escapes are suppressed. The
   continuation join uses `\n` instead of a space so `;` comments
   terminate at the original line boundary.
4. **Scheme-style value printer in the REPL.** Output is `3628800` /
   `(1 2 3)` / `<procedure>`, not `Number: 3628800` and 14-line AST
   dumps. Errors print only their message (no doubled `error: Error:`).
5. **`cond` is implemented in the evaluator.** The parser had been
   building `AST_COND` nodes, but the evaluator had no case for them,
   so every `cond` form returned `LIZARD_ERROR_NODE_TYPE`.
6. **Multi-body function definitions** (`(define (f x) e1 e2 e3)`)
   parse correctly; previously only the first body expression was
   consumed and the rest produced "missing closing paren in define".
7. **`let` accepts non-symbol binding names in macro bodies**, so
   `` `(let ((,name ,value)) ,body) `` works.
8. **Unquote-splicing handles real cons-pair lists**, not only
   `AST_APPLICATION`. Empty list splices to nothing.
9. **Zero-parameter lambdas/macros work.** `((lambda () 42))` and
   `(define-syntax k (lambda () 42))` no longer report "alternative
   lambda parameter format is wrong" — the parser turns `()` into
   `AST_NIL`, which both call paths now accept.
10. **Unbound-symbol errors propagate** instead of being rewritten to
    "attempt to apply a non-function" when they appear in the operator
    position.

## What's verified

`make test`:

```
  PASS  arith_test          (mutation guard, variadic +/-/*//, bignums, div0)
  PASS  control_test        (if, cond/else, begin, and/or/not, let)
  PASS  lambda_test         (recursion, multi-body, mutual, bignum, closures)
  PASS  lists_test          (cons, car/cdr, quote, predicates, user map)
  PASS  macros_test         (quasiquote, splice, special-form expansion, let)
C tests: 5/5 passed
  PASS  error_propagation   (golden-output)
  PASS  scripting           (golden-output)
Lisp tests: 2/2 passed
All tests passed.
```

`make examples` runs all six example files and the prelude without
errors. `06-scripting.lisp` produces a formatted factorial table
ending in `20! is exactly: 2432902008176640000`.

## Open

- `call/cc` still uses module globals (`callcc_buf`, `callcc_active`);
  nested `call/cc` will clobber itself. No regression test for it
  because the existing implementation isn't reliable enough to pin
  golden behaviour to.
- `write` is currently identical to `display` for non-string values.
  In R5RS Scheme, `write` escapes strings (`"a\"b"` would print
  literally). Worth tightening.
- No `string-length`, `string-append`, `number->string` yet — the
  string facilities are minimal. Add when needed by a script.
- Memory: `lizard_heap_destroy` releases everything at REPL exit,
  but inside a long session the bump arena grows and never returns
  memory to the OS (it's grow-only, not a real GC).

# Lizard v4 — performance round

## Tail-call optimisation

Lambda application now tail-calls its **last body expression** by
trampolining through the existing `for(;;)` dispatch loop in
`lizard_eval` — the same mechanism that already drove TCO for `if`,
`begin`, and `cond`. Non-tail bodies are still evaluated for side
effects only, then `(node, env)` are rewritten to the tail body and
`continue` is used.

Before this change every Scheme call ate a real C stack frame:
```lisp
(define (count n) (if (= n 0) 'done (count (- n 1))))
(count 100000)    ; segfault — 8MB C stack exhausted around ~10^4
```

After this change a properly tail-recursive function runs to any
depth limited only by the heap. The new `tco_test.c` exercises
100,000 iterations of plain tail recursion, 50,000 of mutual tail
recursion (`even?`/`odd?`), tail calls out of `cond` clauses, and
tail calls as the last expression of a `begin`.

## Fast bignum primitives

Lizard's bump-allocator heap is grow-only and has no GC, so
loops like
```lisp
(define (pow2-iter n acc) (if (= n 0) acc (pow2-iter (- n 1) (* 2 acc))))
(pow2-iter 1000000 1)
```
allocate `O(N²)` of intermediate bignums and exhaust memory long
before they finish — even with TCO eliminating the stack cost.
MIT Scheme handles this because of its generational GC; lizard
now sidesteps the problem entirely by exposing GMP's fast routines
as primitives so the same computation completes in *one* mpz call:

| Primitive            | Backed by         | Cost     |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| `arithmetic-shift`   | `mpz_mul_2exp` / `mpz_fdiv_q_2exp` | O(1) GMP |
| `expt`               | `mpz_pow_ui`      | O(log e) GMP |
| `gcd`                | `mpz_gcd`         | Lehmer in GMP |
| `lcm`                | `mpz_lcm`         | Lehmer + multiply |
| `quotient`           | `mpz_tdiv_q`      | one division |
| `remainder`          | `mpz_tdiv_r`      | one division |
| `abs`                | `mpz_abs`         | one op |
| `square`             | `mpz_mul`         | one op |
| `modular-expt`       | `mpz_powm`        | O(log e), bounded intermediates |

`(arithmetic-shift 1 1000000)` now produces a 301,030-digit exact
integer in milliseconds. `(modular-expt 2 65537 (- (expt 2 127) 1))`
finishes instantly — the RSA-style core works on arbitrary sizes.

## New tests

- `tests/tco_test.c` — depth-100,000 tail recursion, mutual
  recursion, `cond` and `begin` tail positions.
- `tests/fastprims_test.c` — arithmetic-shift (left/right/huge),
  expt, gcd, lcm, quotient/remainder (with negative dividends),
  abs, square, modular-expt, plus the error paths
  (`(quotient 1 0)`, `(expt 2 -1)`, type mismatch).

## New example

- `examples/14-perf.lisp` — count-down from 1,000,000;
  `arithmetic-shift 1 1000000`; `expt 7 5000`; gcd of two giant
  bignums; a toy RSA encrypt/decrypt cycle.

## What's still not addressed

The arena is still grow-only. Long-running idiomatic Scheme
without the fast primitives still piles up garbage. A real GC
is the right next investment — generational, with the arena
becoming the nursery. That's a larger surgery and was deliberately
kept out of this round so the TCO + fast-prims wins land cleanly.

# Lizard v5 — reflection, types, strings

## Type reflection

```scheme
(type-of 42)           ; 'number
(type-of "hi")         ; 'string
(type-of 'foo)         ; 'symbol
(type-of '(1 2))       ; 'pair
(type-of (lambda(x)x)) ; 'procedure
(type-of +)            ; 'primitive
(type-of #t)           ; 'boolean
```

Returns a symbol naming the runtime type. Covers every AST node
type lizard can produce: number, string, symbol, boolean, nil,
pair, list, procedure, primitive, macro, quote, quasiquote,
promise, error, continuation.

## Environment + procedure introspection

```scheme
(defined? 'my-binding)       ; #t / #f without throwing
(env-keys)                   ; list of every bound symbol in scope
(procedure-arity f)          ; number of formal params, or 'variadic
```

`env-keys` walks every frame from innermost outward; primitives,
user-defined functions, and macros all appear. `procedure-arity`
returns a number for lambdas (counting positional params, including
0 for `(lambda () …)`) and the symbol `'variadic` for C primitives.

## Strings — proper operations, not just opaque blobs

```scheme
(string-length s)
(string-append a b ...)          ; n-ary
(substring s start [end])        ; end defaults to length
(string=? a b)
(number->string n)
(string->number s)               ; -> number, or #f if unparseable
(symbol->string s)
(string->symbol s)
```

The tokenizer also now handles backslash escapes inside string
literals: `\n` `\t` `\r` `\\` `\"` `\0`. Before this change `"say
\"hi\""` lex-failed; now it parses to the obvious 9-char string.

## Records, the lisp-y way

No new C — records are tagged conses with a small Lisp protocol:

```scheme
(define (make-point x y) (make-record 'point (list x y)))
(define (point-x p) (field-nth p 0))
(define (point-y p) (field-nth p 1))
(record? (make-point 3 4))     ; #t
(record-type (make-point 3 4)) ; 'point
```

See `examples/15-types.lisp` for the full pattern. Build on
`record?`, `record-type`, and positional `field-nth` to define any
record shape you want.

## Pattern dispatch

Lizard doesn't have varargs in lambdas, so there's no `syntax-rules`
shaped `match` macro yet. `examples/16-match.lisp` shows a runtime
dispatcher that takes a list of `(tag thunk)` clauses and threads
into the matching one. The example builds a tiny arithmetic
AST, an evaluator, and full symbolic differentiation on top of it:

```
d/dx (3 + 4*x) = (plus (lit 0) (plus (times (lit 0) (var x))
                                     (times (lit 4) (lit 1))))
d/dx -(x + 7) evaluates to -1
```

## New tests

- `tests/reflection_test.c` — every type-of case, defined? for
  bound/unbound/non-symbol args, env-keys completeness via
  member-search, procedure-arity for 0/1/N parameters and
  primitives.
- `tests/strings_test.c` — length/append/substring/equality,
  number↔string round-trip, symbol↔string round-trip, bignum→string,
  out-of-range substring errors.

## New examples

- `examples/15-types.lisp` — reflection, records, an `inspect`
  function that dispatches on `type-of` and prints type-aware
  summaries.
- `examples/16-match.lisp` — pattern dispatcher + symbolic
  differentiation of `(3 + 4x)`, `x*x`, `-(x+7)`.
- `examples/17-strings.lisp` — string manipulation, conversions,
  string-reverse via recursive substring, formatted output helper.

# Lizard v6 — varargs, exceptions, vectors, hashes (extreme edition)

This release adds four major language features and tightens error
semantics so they all compose cleanly.

## Varargs lambdas

```scheme
(define sum (lambda xs
  (define (loop ys acc)
    (if (null? ys) acc (loop (cdr ys) (+ acc (car ys)))))
  (loop xs 0)))

(sum)                  ; 0
(sum 1 2 3 4 5)        ; 15
(sum 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)  ; 55
```

When a `lambda`'s parameter spec is a single symbol instead of a list,
the symbol is bound to a list of *all* the call arguments. This is the
R5RS "rest" form and unlocks `(define (count . xs) ...)`-style
patterns. Implemented at both eval-time and `lizard_apply` call sites.

Dotted-pair varargs `(lambda (a b . rest) ...)` is not yet supported —
that would need new tokenizer support for `.`.

## Exceptions: try / raise / error-object? / error-value

```scheme
(define (safe-div a b)
  (try (lambda () (/ a b))
       (lambda (err)
         (display "caught: ") (display (error-value err)) (newline)
         0)))

(safe-div 10 2)   ; 5
(safe-div  7 0)   ; prints diagnostic, returns 0
```

User code can raise structured payloads:

```scheme
(raise (list 'invalid-input value "must be positive"))
```

The handler receives an error object and uses `(error-value err)` to
unwrap the payload. `error-object?` tests whether a value is an error.

Two C primitives are exempt from auto-propagation (see below) so that
they can *receive* errors as values: `error-object?` and `error-value`.

## Vectors

```scheme
(define v (vector 10 20 30 40 50))
(vector-length v)         ; 5
(vector-ref v 2)          ; 30
(vector-set! v 2 999)
v                         ; #(10 20 999 40 50)
(vector->list v)          ; (10 20 999 40 50)
(list->vector '(a b c))   ; #(a b c)
```

O(1) indexed access + mutation. Fixed-size; create with
`(make-vector n [fill])` or `(vector v1 v2 ...)`. Printer renders as
`#(...)`. `vector?` predicate.

## Hash tables

```scheme
(define h (make-hash-table))
(hash-set! h 'name "lizard")
(hash-set! h 'age 5)
(hash-ref h 'name)              ; "lizard"
(hash-ref h 'missing 'default)  ; default
(hash-has-key? h 'name)         ; #t
(hash-size h)                   ; 2
(hash-keys h)                   ; (age name)
(hash-remove! h 'age)
```

Open-addressed with linear probing. Doubles capacity when load > 0.75.
Hash function: FNV-1a for strings/symbols, mpz_get_ui for numbers.
Key equality is value-based for numbers, strings, symbols, booleans,
and nil. Printer renders as `#hash((k . v) ...)`.

## Auto-propagation of errors

Before this release, `(display (raise 'oops))` would silently print
`oops` because display didn't know its arg was an error. Now errors
short-circuit at every eval boundary:

- **Primitive calls**: if any argument forces to AST_ERROR, the call is
  skipped and the error propagates (except for `error-object?` and
  `error-value`, which receive errors as data).
- **`if`, `cond`**: an erroring predicate propagates without firing
  any branch.
- **`begin`, lambda body**: an intermediate expression that errors
  short-circuits the sequence.

This makes `(try ...)` actually work the way users expect — without
this, a `(raise ...)` inside a `display` call would be silently
absorbed.

## gensym

```scheme
(gensym)              ; g1
(gensym)              ; g2
(gensym "tmp-")       ; tmp-3
```

Produces a fresh symbol on each call. Useful for hand-written
hygienic-ish macros until proper `syntax-rules` lands.

## type-of extended

Now covers vectors and hashes:

```scheme
(type-of (vector 1 2 3))     ; vector
(type-of (make-hash-table))  ; hash
```

## String escape sequences (bonus)

The tokenizer now decodes `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\\`, `\"`, `\0` inside
string literals. Before, `"say \"hi\""` lex-failed.

## New tests

- `tests/exceptions_test.c` — raise + try + nested try + error-value
  with various payload types + system errors (div by zero)
- `tests/vectors_test.c` — every op + mutation persistence + accumulator
  via vector + mixed-type contents + out-of-range errors
- `tests/hashes_test.c` — 200-entry growth stress + key types
  (symbols, strings, bignums) + remove + missing-key + default
- `tests/varargs_test.c` — zero/one/many args + mixed types + variadic
  sum, max, count

## New example

`examples/18-extreme.lisp` exercises all four new features in one
program:
- variadic `puts` formatter dispatching on `type-of`
- in-place insertion-sort on a vector
- word-frequency counter on a hash table
- `safe-div` with try/raise/error-value
- structured `(invalid-age N reason)` payloads with cond-based handler
- fresh gensyms

```

## Known deferred work

- **Hygienic macros (`syntax-rules`)** — would need proper
  alpha-renaming. Significant.
- **Dotted-pair varargs `(lambda (a b . rest) body)`** — tokenizer
  needs `.` handling.
- **Real GC** — currently grow-only arena. A generational collector
  with the arena as the nursery is the obvious next step.
- **call/cc** — exists but uses module globals (`callcc_buf`,
  `callcc_active`), so nested call/cc would collide.
- **`write` vs `display` on strings** — currently identical; R5RS
  says write should escape.

## Phase 3: Deep feature expansion

### Kernel completion
- Sigma types: full inference + computation (proj1/proj2 reduce on pairs).
- J-eliminator: `J C d A a b (refl a) → d a` — the fundamental identity
  elimination principle.
- `sexp_to_kterm` extended: `natrec`, `app`, `lam`, `Pi`, `Sigma`, `pair`,
  `fst`, `snd`, `J`, `Id`, `refl` — the full dependent type theory toolkit.
- `(kernel-reduce expr)` — normalize kernel terms to WHNF.
- `(kernel-equal? a b)` — check definitional equality.

### Proof state + tactics
- `src/tactics.c` + `src/tactics.h` — proof state management.
- `(begin-proof type)` — start proof with one goal.
- `(tactic-intro name)` — introduce Pi binder.
- `(tactic-exact term)` — provide exact proof term.
- `(tactic-refl)` — solve Id a a goals.
- `(qed)` — finish proof, extract term.

### Track C: Atoms
- `(atom val)`, `(deref a)`, `(swap! a f)`, `(reset! a v)`, `(atom? x)`.
- Mutable reference cells with CAS-style swap.

### Exceptions
- `(raise val)` — raise an exception.
- `(guard handler body)` — catch exceptions.

### String operations
- `string-ref`, `string-contains?`, `string-upcase`, `string-downcase`.
- `string-split`, `string-join`.

### Lazy evaluation
- `(delay expr)` — create a promise (thunk).
- `(force p)` — evaluate and cache.
- `(promise? x)` — predicate.

### Standard library (lib/match.lisp)
- sort, zip, partition, flatten, take, drop, any, every, enumerate.
- compose, ->, alist-ref, alist-set, range.
- identity, const, flip, curry, uncurry, repeat, complement, memoize, juxt.

### Persistent data structures
- Persistent vectors: pvec, pvec-ref, pvec-set, pvec-push, pvec-count.
- Persistent hash maps: phash-map, phash-get, phash-set, phash-keys.
- Syntax objects: datum->syntax, syntax->datum, syntax-e, syntax-source.

## Phase 4: Elaboration foundations

### Metavariables / Holes (K.4)
- `KT_META` kernel term tag — placeholder for unknown terms.
- `meta_ctx_t` — metavariable context tracking type, solution, and ID.
- `meta_fresh(heap, mctx, type)` — create a fresh typed hole.
- `meta_solve(mctx, id, solution)` — fill a hole.
- `meta_zonk(heap, mctx, term)` — substitute solved metas in a term.
- `(kernel-hole type)`, `(kernel-solve id term)`, `(kernel-zonk term)`,
  `(kernel-meta-state)` — Lisp-facing primitives.

### Unification (K.5)
- `kt_unify(heap, ctx, mctx, a, b)` — first-order unification.
- Flex-rigid: unsolved meta on one side → solve with the other.
- Structural: recursively unify corresponding subterms.
- Works with WHNF reduction — unfolds definitions before comparing.
- `(kernel-unify a b)` — Lisp-facing primitive.
- `?N` syntax in sexp_to_kterm for metavariable references.

### Kernel Bool + Unit types
- `Bool`, `true`, `false` — boolean type with constructors.
- `(if b t f)` — Bool eliminator with computation rules:
  `if true t f → t`, `if false t f → f`.
- `Unit`, `*` — unit type with unique inhabitant.

# Phase 2U — diagnostic metadata and example-manifest hardening

- Added diagnostic severity/category metadata to `lizard_diagnostic_t`.
- Added severity/category defaulting and public name helpers.
- Parser diagnostics now classify parse failures as `severity=error`, `category=parser`.
- Added API regression coverage for diagnostic metadata.
- Added `scripts/check-example-manifest.sh` for static manifest hygiene checks.
- Hardened `scripts/run-examples.sh` so manifest entries without files are counted and fail CI.
- Added `make examples-audit`.
- Added/restored `examples/63-pow.lisp` so the manifest and filesystem agree.
- Marked currently incomplete showcase examples as experimental instead of dishonest pass gates.

# Phase 2V — restore report API + diagnostic report v2

- Restored the public diagnostic/syntax report typedefs and function prototypes
  required by `diagnostic_report_test.c` and external tooling.
- Added `report_writer.c/.h`, `diagnostic_report.c/.h`, and
  `syntax_expansion_report.c/.h` to the library build.
- Made tokenizer unterminated-string errors recoverable instead of `exit(1)`.
- Added diagnostic report v2 text/JSON output with severity and category fields.
- Added `tests/diagnostic_report_metadata_test.c` for severity/category report
  metadata.
- Fixed `scripts/clean.sh --check` recursion caused by an uncommented usage
  line and allowlisted the legitimate top-level `lib/` directory.
- Kept all strict warning/security flags intact.

# Phase 2W — public report API boundary audit

- Restored `lizard_expansion_trace_event_t` to `include/lizard_api.h` so syntax-object headers can expose trace-event APIs without unknown-type failures.
- Added `tests/api_report_types_test.c` and extended `tests/public_header_test.c` to lock public report/event typedef visibility.
- Added `scripts/check-public-api.sh` and `make api-audit` to prevent future accidental removal of report/syntax public API types.
- Added `api-audit` to the `ci` target.
- Kept strict/security warning flags intact and added no warning suppressions.

# Phase 2Z — diagnostic construction unification

- Added `src/diagnostics.c` / `src/diagnostics.h` as the canonical diagnostic/span construction path.
- Added public diagnostic construction helpers: `lizard_source_span_clear`, `lizard_source_span_set`, `lizard_diagnostic_clear`, `lizard_diagnostic_set`, `lizard_diagnostic_set_simple`, and `lizard_diagnostic_copy`.
- Moved diagnostic severity/category default mapping and name lookup into `diagnostics.c`.
- Refactored tokenizer, parser, runtime, and syntax-expansion reports to use the shared diagnostic helpers.
- Added `tests/diagnostic_construction_test.c` and `tests/diagnostic_category_paths_test.c`.
- Extended `scripts/check-public-api.sh` to guard the diagnostic construction API.
- Kept diagnostic report v2 stable and preserved text/JSON output shapes.
- No strict/security warning flags were removed and no warning suppressions were added.

# Phase 3B — GC metadata side-table scaffold

- Added `src/gc_metadata.c` / `src/gc_metadata.h`.
- Added a C-owned per-heap side table for object size/kind/owner/trace-policy metadata.
- Wired heap creation/destruction to create/destroy the side table.
- Wired heap allocation to register metadata opportunistically without changing allocation semantics.
- Added metadata stats and lookup helpers through `gc.h`.
- Added `tests/gc_metadata_test.c`.
- Extended ownership audit coverage for the metadata side table.
- Kept object layout, mark traversal, sweep behavior, evaluator semantics, and strict warning policy unchanged.

# Phase 3C — liblizard build graph closure audit

- Fixed the syntax-object scaffold link regression class by making `LIB_SRCS`
  close over additional `src/*.c` modules automatically while keeping the core
  source order explicit.
- Added `scripts/check-build-graph.py` to audit that implementation sources are
  represented in the library build graph and that stale `LIB_SRCS` entries are
  rejected.
- Added `make build-graph-audit` and wired it into `make ci`.
- Preserved strict compiler/security flags; no warning suppressions were added.

# Phase 3D — conservative build graph recovery

- Replaced the aggressive Phase 3C `src/*.c` library closure with a conservative allowlisted optional-source closure.
- Prevented incomplete experimental modules such as `prims_kernel_*`, `prims_modules`, `prims_bytecode`, and `kernel_sexp` from being compiled merely because they exist in `src/`.
- Added `scripts/phase3d-recover-build.py` for idempotent recovery of locally drifted Phase 3 trees.
- Hardened public/report header boundaries for report schema and expansion trace APIs.
- Added parser/tokenizer prototypes required by syntax-object scaffolding.
- Replaced the build-graph audit with an allowlist-aware audit.
- Kept all strict/security flags intact and added no warning suppressions.

# Phase 3E — public API duplicate-definition recovery

- Fixed duplicate `lizard_expansion_trace_event_t` definition in `include/lizard_api.h`.
- Added `scripts/check-public-api-duplicates.py` to reject duplicate public typedef/enum definitions.
- Wired duplicate-definition checks into `make api-audit` through `scripts/check-public-api.sh`.
- Hardened `scripts/phase3d-recover-build.py` so repeated recovery runs remove duplicate public API blocks instead of appending more.
- Kept strict warning/security flags unchanged.

# Phase 3G — context expansion trace public API recovery

- Restored context-level expansion trace public API declarations in `include/lizard_api.h`.
- Added `scripts/phase3g-recover-trace-context-api.py` for mixed local trees.
- Extended `scripts/check-public-api.sh` so `make api-audit` catches missing trace context declarations.
- No strict/security warning flags were removed and no warning suppressions were added.

# Phase 3H — surface filename propagation and audit cleanup

- Propagated caller-provided filenames through tokenizer/source parsing into parser diagnostics, top-level AST spans, SurfaceTerm spans, expansion trace origins, and traced context evaluation.
- Made `lizard_context_eval_file` route through a filename-aware internal evaluation path so file diagnostics report the real path instead of `<string>`.
- Restored direct `lizard_api.h` inclusion for `surface_term.h` to satisfy header-boundary audits.
- Updated ownership/build-graph audits for the current live bridge/report modules.
- Added `.gitignore` and removed generated build artifacts plus wrong-project leftovers from the packaged tree.
- Kept strict compiler/security flags unchanged.
