# Lizard — Limitations

This document is candid about what lizard does, doesn't, and can't (in
this codebase's current state) do. It's organized from "small,
fixable" through "deliberately out of scope" to "would require a
research project."

If you're evaluating lizard for thesis support, this is the document
to read carefully. The capability statements in `README.md` are
accurate but optimistic in tone; this document is the corresponding
pessimistic accounting.

## 1. Things deliberately out of scope

These are *design decisions* — not bugs, but real limitations:

**Faces are represented as inhabiting `(U 0)` rather than a separate
sort.** A stricter type theory would put faces in their own decidable
propositional sort. Our simplification is sound for typing purposes
(faces and types are disjoint in actual use), but it doesn't preserve
the sort distinction.

**Equivalences are `(equiv-fun, equiv-inv)`, not `Σ f. isEquiv f`.**
Real CCHM uses contractible-fibers equivalences, which carry coherence
data needed for the full comp Glue rule. Our representation:
- ✓ Sufficient for stating `(ua e) : Path U A B`.
- ✓ Correct for `id-equiv` (where forward and backward are obviously
  inverse).
- ✗ Doesn't capture that arbitrary `equiv-fun ∘ equiv-inv` is path-equal
  to identity.

**Single-face Glue.** `(Glue A φ T e)` takes one face only. The general
`ua` definition in CCHM uses Glue with a *system* of two clauses
(`(i=i0) ↦ (A, e)` and `(i=i1) ↦ (B, id-equiv B)`). We could express
the unary case but not the binary case as a single Glue term.

**HITs are partially supported.** The HIT layer is split into two tiers:

- **Scaffolds.** AST nodes for `S1`/`base`/`loop`, generic `theory-extension`, and the H.1 declaration registry exist. These are opt-in via logic rules and have minimal typing only. No recursors, no computation rules for path constructors, no Kan composition with the motive. The scaffold layer is intentionally limited — see `docs/OPTIONAL_PROOF_SCAFFOLDS.md` for the migration path.

- **Checked: propositional truncation.** `Trunc level A`, `trunc value`, `trunc-elim motive handler value` have real typing rules and a primary computation rule `(trunc-elim C h (trunc x)) ⟶ (@ h x)`. Gated on `truncations-enabled`. Honest gap: the propositionality obligation on the motive C (any two values path-equal) is not structurally enforced — see `docs/CLAIMS_MATRIX.md`.

Bringing the scaffolds up to checked status (especially S¹ with loop computation and Kan composition) is the same kind of work as Cubical Agda's HIT implementation, which is non-trivial.

## 2. Things that work but are incomplete

These are *capabilities that exist but have honest gaps*:

### comp Pi: non-dependent only

```c
comp^i (Pi x:A. B) [φ ↦ u] u0   -->   Lambda y. comp^i B [...] (u0 y)
```

We implement this rule only when `B` doesn't mention `x` (the
non-dependent case). The dependent case requires transporting the
argument `y` backward across the type family's domain — using `fill`
on the domain line — which the current `fill` doesn't compute.

**What works:** `comp^i (Pi x:A. B) ...` when B doesn't mention x.
**What doesn't:** general dependent comp Pi.

### comp Sum: empty partial only

```c
comp^i (Sum A B) [φ ↦ u] (Inl x)  -->  Inl (comp^i A [...] x)
```

We push comp through canonical sum constructors only when the partial
is empty (`system-nil` or `F0` face). The general case requires
case-analysis on the partial at each face.

### comp Path: works via systems

We build the inner system with three clauses correctly. But the inner
comp may not fully reduce — it depends on the specifics of the partial
element.

### comp Glue: simplified

We produce `(glue-intro φ T-comp A-comp)` with the right shape, but the
T-comp uses `equiv-fun ∘ u0` instead of the full CCHM construction via
contractibility. This is correct for `id-equiv` (where `equiv-fun = id`)
but doesn't construct the proper coherence proof for general
equivalences.

### `(ua e) @ i` for non-identity equivalences

```c
(ua (id-equiv A)) @ i  -->  A         ✓ works
(ua e) @ i              -->  (stays unreduced for non-id e)
```

The general case would emit a Glue type with a two-clause system, which
needs the multi-face Glue extension above.

### `fill` is now reducing

`(fill A φ u u0)` now has a reduction rule. The CCHM rule:

```
fill A [φ ↦ u] u0  =  <k> comp A_narrowed [φ ↦ u_narrowed,
                                            (k=i0) ↦ <i>u0] u0
```

is implemented: fill produces a path-abs binding a fresh `k`, with the
type family and partial narrowed by `(i ∧ k)` and an extra system
clause pinning the `k = i0` face to the base. For constant families
and empty partials this collapses to `<k> u0`. For non-trivial inputs
the inner comp chains through the comp rules of the underlying type.

### Face entailment is sound but incomplete

`face-entails? φ ψ` returns one of:
- `#t` — definitely entails
- `#f` — definitely does not
- `'unknown` — can't decide from the structure

For example, `(φ ∧ ψ) ⊨ φ` returns `#t` (left-projection of `F-and`),
but more complex cases like distributing over disjunctions can return
`unknown` even when the entailment holds.

This is intentional — sound but incomplete, which is the right
behavior for a decision procedure that can't be complete.

### `path-abs` alpha-equality requires same binder name

Two path-abstractions `(<i> body1)` and `(<j> body2)` are alpha-equal
only if `i = j` as strings. The proper alpha-equivalence under
interval-variable renaming is not implemented — we'd need to extend
the binder environment machinery to track interval variables
separately.

In practice this means: use consistent binder names. Most code does
anyway.

## 3. Things lizard *cannot* claim

These are *non-claims* that should be flagged:

**Lizard does NOT have a soundness proof.** No formal verification of
the rules. No proof that the typing rules and reduction rules are
mutually consistent in the sense that well-typed terms don't reduce
to ill-typed ones. The rules are *intended* to be sound (they
transcribe published CCHM rules), but no proof is attached.

**Decidability of type checking is NOT proved.** The checker is
correct on the cases it handles — but we don't have a proof that
every well-formed term either type-checks or fails in bounded time.
For some pathological inputs the normalization could in principle
loop (though in practice on realistic terms it doesn't).

**Canonicity is NOT proved.** A central correctness property for a
type theory is: every closed term of base type reduces to a canonical
form. We demonstrate this property *holds for specific examples* (the
end-to-end ua-id-equiv transport), but we don't have a general proof.

**Normalization termination is NOT proved.** No proof that reduction
always terminates. We rely on structural decrease in practice but
nothing prevents a cycle in principle.

**Strict regularity is NOT enforced.** CCHM requires that
`comp [F0 ↦ ⊥] u0 ≡ u0` *definitionally* — not just up to reduction.
We implement it as a reduction rule; the *definitional* version
requires that the equality is built into convertibility checking at
a deeper level than rule firing.

## 4. Things lizard is honestly not, despite the cubical layer

It is not Cubical Agda. It is not RedTT. It is not cubicaltt. Those
systems have:

- Thousands of lines of code (lizard's cubical layer is hundreds)
- Years of development by full-time research engineers
- Published soundness proofs
- Decidable typechecking proven
- Full HIT support
- Polished surface syntax (lizard's is s-expressions)
- Industrial-scale proof developments using them

Lizard's cubical layer is a six-turn implementation of the core CCHM
pipeline. It demonstrates the *mechanism* but is not a substitute for
production proof assistants.

## 5. What lizard *is* good for

Despite all the above, lizard is honestly useful for:

- **Understanding cubical type theory** by reading and running small
  examples that show each rule firing.
- **Experimenting with rule variations** via the flag system — every
  reduction rule is toggleable, so you can disable parts of the engine
  and see how the rest behaves.
- **Pedagogy** — the cubical layer is small enough to read in a sitting,
  with each rule clearly labeled and documented inline.
- **Thesis support** for type-theory work that doesn't need full
  industrial features — like couniverse-stratified frameworks where the
  implementation supports the framework rather than being the
  contribution.
- **A platform for further development** — the architecture is
  consistent enough that adding a new construct is a checklist of
  10 places, not an open-ended refactor.

## 6. If you want to push further

The natural next-turn items, in increasing order of effort:

1. **Sharper face entailment.** Improve the decision procedure to
   handle more cases of `(φ_1 ∨ φ_2) ⊨ ψ` and similar. Bounded work.

2. **Glue-with-system AST extension.** Replace single-face Glue with
   one that takes a system of (face, T, e) clauses. Would let the
   general `(ua e) @ i` rule construct the proper interior Glue.
   Maybe 2-3 turns.

3. **Dependent comp Pi.** Implement `fill` on the domain line and use
   it to transport the argument backward. Then update comp Pi.
   Probably 2 turns.

4. **HIT framework.** Generic mechanism for declaring higher
   inductive types and their computation rules. Significant — multiple
   turns, with subtle interactions with comp.

5. **Soundness proof.** Would require either implementing the type
   theory in a proof assistant or building lizard atop a verified
   reduction-rule kernel. Months of work, not a single push.

6. **Decidability of typechecking proof.** Same magnitude as
   soundness.

For all of (4)-(6), the realistic statement is: these are research
projects, not implementation tasks. Lizard is an artifact suitable
for pushing through (1) and (2), arguably (3), and not designed to
support (4)-(6) within its current architecture.

## Computer algebra (lib/cas.lisp, lib/cas-proof.lisp)

The CAS is a working symbolic engine (simplification, differentiation,
basic integration) but a deliberately small one — it is a foundation to
build on, not a Maxima replacement. Specifically:

- **Simplification is shallow.** It applies the obvious identities
  (x+0, x*1, x*0, x^0, x^1, constant folding) but does not normalize
  fully, collect like terms, or canonicalize. Two equal expressions may
  print differently.
- **Integration handles only simple polynomial cases.** No
  substitution, parts, partial fractions, or special functions.
- **The proof layer is a justification SKELETON, not a checked proof.**
  `cas-proof.lisp` records which named rule justifies each step and
  unfolds the dependency chain down to ZFC. But the rule *statements*
  are informal strings and the dependency *edges* are asserted, not
  machine-verified. It demonstrates the architecture of a verified CAS;
  it is not yet one. `docs/CAS.md` describes the path to discharging the
  rules against the trusted kernel.

In short: the CAS computes correctly on its supported fragment, and the
proof layer faithfully shows the logical dependency structure down to
the axioms — but turning "cited" into "checked" is future work, tracked
in `docs/CAS.md`.

## Real quantifier elimination: the remaining frontier in general-n section lifting

The general n >= 3 decider (cadcomplete.lisp) samples the outer variable at true breakpoints and recurses, reaching
sections of every dimension whose coordinates are RATIONAL at each level (full-dimensional cells, rational sections,
and -- through the complete two-variable base -- two-variable fibers with irrational coordinates).  When an OUTER
section coordinate is itself irrational, the decider currently recurses at a rational probe inside that coordinate's
isolating interval, which catches the full-dimensional and rational-fiber witnesses lying over the section but
delegates the genuinely irrational-outer-coordinate section witnesses to the diagonal recognizer and the tower
search (cadtower / cadrc).  Carrying the algebraic outer coordinate symbolically down the recursion in a tower
Q(alpha_1)(alpha_2)... -- the full ascending lifting phase of a general CAD over towers of real algebraic numbers --
is the deep remaining piece; it is the part real CAD implementations spent years engineering, and it is named here
honestly rather than papered over.  Everything the decider reports is sound; what is bounded is which irrational
sections it can newly CONSTRUCT a witness on.

## Update: coupled regular chains are now decided

The note above described coupled chains -- defining polynomials mixing several lower variables at once -- as the
residual generality beyond the simple iterated-extension tower.  That gap is now closed: cadtow2.lisp's coupled-chain
path reads such a chain in cadrc.lisp's representation and decides sign and vanishing at the chain point by the
multivariate resultant, so witnesses like sqrt(2), 2^(1/4), 2^(3/4) of x^2 = 2 and y^2 = x and z = x*y are found.
What remains genuinely open is scale and the general coupled-fiber NONZERO sign in the hardest cases (cadrc decides
vanishing for the general chain exactly, and the nonzero sign by a converging top-down box; cadrc-fiber-sign-caveat
names the residual), together with the unavoidable doubly-exponential cost of CAD itself.

## Update: parametric QE present; coupled-fiber sign exact; a univariate completeness bug fixed

Three further gaps named earlier are now addressed. (1) Quantifier elimination with a free PARAMETER -- not just
deciding closed sentences -- is provided by cadqe.lisp for one parameter and one quantified variable, via the CAD of
the parameter line (exists x. x^2+b<0 -> b<0). The general multi-parameter parametric CAD remains the open scope
(cadqe-caveat). (2) The general coupled-fiber NONZERO sign in cadrc.lisp is now exact via anchored box refinement,
so both vanishing and sign are complete for the general regular chain. (3) A completeness bug in the univariate
decider -- an existential equality at an even-multiplicity root reported false -- was fixed by testing vanishing on
the square-free part. What remains genuinely open is SCALE in the worst case (mitigated, not removed, by the
cadwit partial-CAD witness accelerator) and the inherent doubly-exponential cost of CAD itself (Davenport-Heintz),
which is a theorem about the problem, not a limitation of this implementation.

## Update: two-parameter quantifier elimination present

Parametric QE now extends from one parameter (cadqe.lisp) to TWO (cadqe2.lisp): the discriminant locus
exists x. x^2+bx+c=0 -> b^2-4c>=0 and similar are computed by decomposing the parameter PLANE via the multivariate
resultant projection and reading the answer as sign conditions on the projection factors. The open scope is now
three or more parameters -- the general parametric CAD over a higher-dimensional parameter space -- together with
minimal solution-formula construction (producing the simplest equivalent formula, Brown's problem), and the inherent
doubly-exponential cost of CAD itself (Davenport-Heintz), which is a theorem about the problem.

## Update: three-parameter QE (the general quadratic) present; a solution-formula simplifier added

Parametric QE now extends to THREE parameters (cadqe3.lisp): the general quadratic exists x. a*x^2+b*x+c=0 with a
free leading coefficient, whose answer is the leading-coefficient case split, not the discriminant alone. A
solution-formula simplifier (cadqesimp.lisp) minimizes the raw sign-vector output toward a compact formula, reaching
the exact textbook relation on the clean cases. What remains genuinely open: FOUR or more parameters (the general
parametric CAD over a higher-dimensional parameter space), and TRUE minimality of solution formulas over three-valued
sign covers (Brown's problem -- cadqesimp reduces but does not guarantee the global minimum). The doubly-exponential
cost of CAD itself (Davenport-Heintz) remains inherent to the problem, not a limitation of this implementation.

## Update: parametric QE now reaches arbitrary parameter dimension

Parametric QE is no longer capped at three parameters: cadqen.lisp eliminates one quantified variable over a
parameter space of ANY dimension k by recursion (project the outer parameter, sample, substitute, recurse), with the
parameter line as the base. It reproduces cadqe3 on the general quadratic (k=3) and solves a genuine four-parameter
linear-system problem (the resultant locus). What remains genuinely open: TRUE minimality of solution formulas over
three-valued sign covers (Brown's problem -- cadqesimp reduces but does not guarantee the global minimum), the
supplied (rather than fully auto-computed) projection for arbitrary non-uniform-degree input, and the inherent
doubly-exponential cost of CAD in the parameter dimension (Davenport-Heintz), which is a theorem about the problem.

## Update: true minimal solution formulas (prime-implicant cover)

The simplest-formula phase of parametric QE is now implemented: cadqemin.lisp computes a minimal cover of the true
sign-cells by prime implicants with don't-cares, returning the exact textbook three-branch law for the general
quadratic. What remains genuinely open: exact GLOBAL minimum cover (NP-hard, Brown's hard core -- cadqemin uses
essential-plus-greedy, exact on standard cases), and complete BOUNDARY sampling (the independent-axis sampler can
miss measure-zero tangent cells, so on a sampled partition cadqemin trades some minimality for soundness via
conservative validity). The doubly-exponential cost of CAD in the parameter dimension (Davenport-Heintz) remains
inherent.

## Update: exact boundary sampling completes the partition for rational-root projections

The minimal-formula gap was the sampler, now closed for rational-root projections: cadqenx.lisp samples each
parameter level at the EXACT rational roots of the projection factors (rational root theorem), capturing the
measure-zero boundary cells (discriminant exactly zero, the tangent stratum) that approximate sampling missed. The
general quadratic now yields a complete true/false partition (true cells 23 -> 27), on which cadqemin produces a
genuine three-branch minimal formula directly from the sweep. What remains open: IRRATIONAL-root projections (exact
section sampling would need algebraic-number sample points, so conservative validity still applies there); exact
GLOBAL minimum cover (NP-hard, Brown's hard core); and the inherent doubly-exponential cost of CAD (Davenport-Heintz).

## Update: four boundaries addressed (irrational sections, exact cover, scale filter, cost theorem)

Irrational boundary surfaces are now sampled exactly for the one-parameter sweep (cadqenr.lisp, algebraic-number
sections); the minimal-formula cover can be computed as a provable global minimum (cadqemin-cover-exact, branch and
bound); a sound dimension-independent UNSAT filter settles a class of large infeasible problems without a
decomposition (cadunsat.lisp); and the doubly-exponential cost is documented as the Davenport-Heintz theorem with
cell growth measured directly. What remains genuinely open: MULTI-PARAMETER algebraic-number sections (the tower of
extensions cadqenr does not build for k >= 2), and the worst-case doubly-exponential cost itself, which is inherent
to the problem and cannot be removed -- only avoided on the easy instances, which cadwit and cadunsat do.
